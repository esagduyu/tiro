# Project Tiro — Product Roadmap

Review date: 2026-05-25
Updated: 2026-05-26 (strategic decisions: pricing, license, Obsidian sync, X connector); 2026-07-04 (Phase 0 marked complete; Decision 0 strategy inputs recorded 2026-07-03); 2026-07-04 (v0.2.0 tagged; Decisions #7–8: AI-layer plan, subscription-CLI backends, LLM wiki; Phase 1 foundation milestone expanded; Phase 1b added); 2026-07-10 (Phases 4 & 5 shipped; frontend design pass merged; iOS v1.0 feature-complete); 2026-07-18 (Phases 6 & 7a shipped: v0.8.0 + v0.9.0 tagged + released; v1.0.0 gate GREEN)
Status (2026-07-18): Phases 0 through 7a are **complete and shipped** — the entire v1.0 ladder is on `main`: **`v0.8.0` agents-beta** (Phase 6, agent runtime) and **`v0.9.0` sync-beta** (Phase 7a, BYO multi-device sync) were tagged + released 2026-07-18. Earlier releases: — 0.2.0 (security & integrity), 0.3.0 (Phase 1, library integrity), 0.3.5 (Phase 1b W1, library wiki), 0.4.0 (Phase 2, highlights & notes), **`v0.5.0` (Phase 3, private remote access + mobile PWA)**, **`v0.6.0` (Phase 4, RSS + imports)**, and **`v0.7.0` (Phase 5, installable desktop app)**. Two additional bodies of work shipped alongside: the **"Codex" frontend design pass** (merged) and the **native iOS v1.0 client** (SwiftUI thin client in the separate local repo `~/repos/tiro-ios`, tag `v0.1.0-tf1`; TestFlight-pending — see `tiro-ios/docs/TESTFLIGHT.md`).

**⟶ THE v1.0 CAMPAIGN IS CODE-COMPLETE (2026-07-18).** 1.0 = **the local-complete product = 0.7 + Phase 6 (0.8, shipped) + Phase 7a (0.9, shipped)** (owner-ratified 2026-07-10); Tiro Cloud (7b) is a **post-1.0 (1.x) business launch**. `main` carries the whole ladder at **1915 Python + 165 node tests, 0 warnings**, migration chain 1..18. **The v1.0.0 go/no-go gate is GREEN** (S2 property suite + S5 multi-device suite). Remaining before the v1.0.0 tag: the owner's physical acceptance matrix, a version-bump commit, and the tag itself. Phase 2b remains absorbed into Phase 7a (Decision #9). Origin: hackathon top-30 (out of ~500).

## Path to v1.0

**Definition:** v1.0.0 = the fully local, fully owned product a user can run forever without paying — 0.7 (shipped) + Phase 6 agent runtime (→ 0.8) + Phase 7a BYO sync (→ 0.9). This is the principled reading of Decision #5 (BYO-first) and VISION.md principle 4 (data ownership): everything a user needs is free and local before any hosted convenience exists. Tiro Cloud (7b) becomes the 1.x launch on top of a finished product.

**Operating docs (all under `docs/plans/`, local-only/gitignored):**
- **Coordinator handoff runbook — START HERE on resume:** `2026-07-11-campaign-handoff-runbook.md` (ladder, plan index, merge protocol, guardrails, failure playbooks, decision authority).
- **Campaign decision log (D1–D15) + owner-review items:** `2026-07-10-overnight-decisions.md`.
- The five core principles every milestone is judged against: `VISION.md` (repo root, committed).

**Milestone ladder** (each remaining rung has a full, decision-complete, non-Fable-executable plan banked; migrations pre-assigned 014–018):

| Rung | Delivers | Migration | Plan | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| K1 | Runtime kernel (contract/context/traces/`agent_runs`) + MetadataExtractor | 014 | `2026-07-10-agents-k1-k2-plan.md` | ✅ merged |
| K2 | Migrate 3 features + `/agents` UI + replay + evals | — | (same) | ✅ merged |
| K3 | Personas + structural sandbox + suggestions | 017 | `2026-07-10-agents-k3-plan.md` | ✅ merged |
| K4 | ContradictionDetector (owner-priority agent) → **0.8.0** | — | `2026-07-11-agents-k4-contradiction-plan.md` | ✅ merged → **v0.8.0 tagged 2026-07-18** |
| S1 | Local reconcile engine (Obsidian bidi; absorbed 2b) | 015 | `2026-07-10-sync-s1-reconcile-plan.md` | ✅ merged |
| S2 | Pure merge core (**½ of the 1.0 gate: property suite**) | 016 | `2026-07-10-sync-s2-merge-core-plan.md` | ✅ merged, property gate GREEN |
| S3 | Blob format, age crypto, snapshot/journal | — | `2026-07-11-sync-s3-format-crypto-plan.md` | ✅ merged |
| S4 | Storage adapters (filesystem/S3/WebDAV) + conformance | — | `2026-07-11-sync-s4-adapters-plan.md` | ✅ merged |
| S5 | Engine loop + `/settings/sync` (**½ of the 1.0 gate: multi-device suite**) | 018 | `2026-07-11-sync-s5-engine-plan.md` | ✅ merged, multi-device gate GREEN |
| S6 | Hardening + acceptance drills → **0.9.0** | — | `2026-07-11-sync-s6-hardening-plan.md` | ✅ merged → **v0.9.0 tagged 2026-07-18** |

**The v1.0.0 go/no-go gate (hard, never shaved): ✅ MET 2026-07-18** — S2's hypothesis property suite AND S5's multi-device integration suite both green on merged `main` (coordinator-re-verified 3× random-seed). The rule as it stood: If not, ship **0.9.0-beta** with sync behind explicit opt-in and let 1.0 slip — a subtly-wrong merge engine loses user data and violates principle 4. **Version tags are owner-only** (0.8.0 on K4, 0.9.0 on S6, v1.0.0 on the combined gate). **Scope cuts (post-1.0, decided):** R5 roster agents incl. ImportanceScorer, P6 plugin API, code signing/notarization, all of 7b.

**Owner-review items carried into 1.0 — RATIFIED by owner 2026-07-18** (detail in the decision log; kept for the record): (1) ratify the agent-trace backup posture — traces excluded from `tiro backup`, `agent_runs` rows survive via the DB copy (recommend accept, same as vectors/audio); (2) S1's Obsidian-rename footgun — a rename outside Tiro reads as delete+re-ingest, dropping that article's annotations (documented in README; rename-aware reconcile is S2+ scope); (3) real-device/physical acceptance for S6 (2 laptops + phone) is owner-only, never agent-simulated; (4) carried pre-1.0 owner items from the desktop runbook (signing, ghcr first push) remain in `docs/RUNBOOK-desktop.md`.

## How To Use This Document

Each phase below is **self-contained**: a planning agent should be able to read the front matter (Executive Summary, Product Strategy, Principles, Codebase Health) plus a single phase section and produce an executable plan without consulting other phases.

For each phase you will find:

- **Goal** — one sentence describing the outcome.
- **Why this phase, why now** — strategic justification and dependencies on earlier phases.
- **In scope** — concrete deliverables, with file paths from the current codebase where relevant.
- **Out of scope** — explicit non-goals to prevent scope creep.
- **Dependencies** — prerequisite phases or features.
- **Acceptance criteria** — testable conditions that define "done."
- **Test plan** — what must be verified and how.
- **Risks and gotchas** — known pitfalls, including any from `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Release target** — version label.

Phases are ordered by product impact, not engineering effort. No wall-clock time estimates are given because agents can run continuously; instead each phase is labeled with **Relative Complexity** (S / M / L / XL) so phases can be sequenced and resourced.

When a phase calls for changes in code already documented in `CLAUDE.md`, the agent should re-read that file and the relevant module before planning. The "Gotchas" sub-section in each phase highlights the most likely traps but is not exhaustive.

## Executive Summary

Tiro is a local-first, model-agnostic reading OS. The hackathon build (17 spec checkpoints + 6 beyond-spec) shipped a complete demo: article and newsletter ingestion, AI enrichment via Claude Opus/Haiku, three-variant daily digests, semantic search, knowledge graph, reading stats, TTS audio, Gmail integration, MCP server, Chrome extension, and a Roman-themed responsive UI.

The product thesis works. The architecture is coherent. The remaining question is **trust**: can this be installed by another human, run for months, and hold their reading life without losing data, leaking secrets, or breaking silently?

The roadmap below is a path from "impressive demo" to "Obsidian-style local-first product with optional paid hosted convenience." It begins with a security release because the current build has working features layered on a localhost-only threat model that no longer matches LAN/phone/daemon use cases. It then prioritizes the features that change daily usage (highlights, RSS, private remote) before the features that change delivery (desktop packaging, cloud sync), because installing an app you do not yet love is friction.

## Product Strategy

Tiro is positioned as a personal reading OS with four deploy modes:

1. **Tiro Local** — free, open-source, fully local. Users run it on their laptop or home server. They bring their own API keys or use local models.
2. **Tiro Private Remote** — still self-hosted, but easy to reach from phone/tablet through Tailscale or another private network. The bridge between local-first and daily use.
3. **Tiro Local + BYO Cloud Sync** — free and open. Users sync their library to a storage backend they own (S3, Backblaze B2, Dropbox, iCloud Drive, Google Drive, a self-hosted MinIO). Tiro never touches the data; the user's storage account is the source of truth across devices.
4. **Tiro Cloud (paid)** — hosted sync, hosted agent runtime, managed AI baseline. Patterned on Obsidian Sync: it is a convenience subscription that funds the open product, not a gate to features. Everything Tiro Cloud does, the user can do themselves with BYO sync + their own API keys.

The product promise: original source files remain clean and portable; user-created memory (highlights, notes, ratings, digests, AI outputs) lives in adjacent local files and transparent databases; anything paid makes the system easier to run across devices, not worse to own locally. **A user who never pays Tiro a cent should be able to use every feature.**

The product itself decomposes into three components the phases advance: (1) the **Reader** — the context layer a user thinks in (highlights, notes, sidecar files that compound over time; Phases 2/2b); (2) the **Agentic layer** — the intelligence that works the library (digests, knowledge graph, learned preferences today; the inspectable Phase 6 runtime tomorrow); (3) the **Management layer** — the inbox-zero control surface that suggests what to read and makes catching up fast, on phone too (Phases 3/4). Phases 0, 1, 5, 7a, and 7b are foundation and delivery for all three.

**North-star metric: daily-use adoption.** Every phase and feature is justified against one question: does this get more people using Tiro daily? Measured via opt-in telemetry (see Telemetry & Observability cross-cutting track — always opt-in, never default-on) plus public proxies (downloads, GitHub stars, community activity).

## Product Principles

> **`VISION.md` (added 2026-07-10) is the authoritative statement of Tiro's five core principles** — the reading library, inbox management, tracking & intelligence, data ownership, and compounding knowledge — and the standard every feature and phase is judged against. Read it alongside this front matter before planning. The engineering-posture principles below stand unchanged; they are the operational form of VISION.md's principles 3, 4, and 5.

- **Local-first, cloud-optional** — local use must remain first-class and never feel like a trial.
- **Source-preserving** — never mutate the original saved article markdown to store personal data. Use sidecars.
- **Bring-your-own-AI by default** — API keys, local models, and external assistants must all be supported.
- **Hosted AI as convenience** — paid AI should be a bundled baseline, not the only path.
- **Agentic but inspectable** — agents leave logs, cited inputs, outputs, and replayable traces.
- **Private remote before public sharing** — phone access through private networks matters before collaborative/social features.
- **Plain-file escape hatch** — export, backup, and Obsidian-style interoperability are core product features, not afterthoughts.

## External Product Assumptions

- **Tailscale Serve** is the default recommendation for private access; it exposes a local service only inside the user's tailnet. **Tailscale Funnel** is useful later for public sharing but is a distinct risk class because it exposes a service to the broader internet. See Tailscale's docs for [Serve](https://tailscale.com/docs/reference/tailscale-cli/serve) and [Funnel](https://tailscale.com/docs/features/tailscale-funnel).
- **Claude paid plans and the Anthropic API are separate products.** A Claude Pro or Max subscription is not a backend API entitlement. See Anthropic's [Claude paid plans vs. API access](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8114521-how-can-i-access-the-claude-api). Tiro never drives consumer *web UIs*; headless **agent-CLI backends** (`claude -p`, Codex CLI) are a distinct, owner-decided surface for the local-only alpha — see Decision #7 for scope, ToS caveats, and the hard rule that hosted Tiro (7b) never touches subscription credentials.
- **OpenAI's agent direction** points toward tool-using workflows, evals, and embeddable agent experiences. Tiro should expose its library through tools and agent contracts rather than only direct one-off model calls. See [OpenAI Agents documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/agents).
- **MCP remains strategically important** because it lets external assistants use Tiro as a knowledge tool. See the [Claude Code SDK MCP docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sdk/sdk-mcp).

## Codebase Health Summary

> **2026-07-04 note (updated 2026-07-06):** this section is the pre-Phase-0 snapshot (2026-05-25) that motivated the plan. Everything under "Severe issues" and "Quality issues" was resolved by Phase 0 (0.2.0); "Test coverage" grew from zero to 169 tests at 0.2.0 and stands at 866 pytest + 140 node tests plus seven Playwright specs at 0.5.0. Kept for historical context — do not re-fix these.

Verified during this review:

**Strengths**
- Clean module boundaries: ingestion, intelligence, search, export, stats, TTS, MCP, API routes are separate.
- Expensive AI work moved off the event loop via `asyncio.to_thread()`.
- Background tasks (IMAP, digest scheduler) created/cancelled in FastAPI lifespan.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/plans/` preserve unusually high-quality design memory and root-cause notes.
- Storage portable: markdown files + SQLite + ChromaDB.

**Severe issues (block public alpha)**
- No authentication. `tiro/app.py:184` sets `allow_origins=["*"]` with `allow_credentials=True`. Any browser tab can call any endpoint. LAN mode (`--lan`) makes this worse.
- No article deletion anywhere in `tiro/api/`. Local-first ownership without delete is product-broken.
- Markdown rendered with `marked.parse()` → `innerHTML` in `reader.js` and `app.js`. XSS via hostile saved articles will run in the Tiro origin.
- Ingestion is not atomic across markdown file, SQLite row, ChromaDB vector, stats, and AI metadata. Partial failures leave orphans in any of four stores.
- Settings routes (`tiro/api/routes_settings.py`) hardcode `Path("config.yaml")`, ignoring the active `--config` path.

**Quality issues (papercuts)**
- Stats inflate on every read/rate write (not only on first transition). Re-opening articles inflates `articles_read` and reading time.
- IMAP background task starts only at startup; enabling IMAP via Settings does not start it (digest scheduler does this correctly — pattern exists to copy).
- Custom theme settings are persisted but `applyTheme()` hardcodes built-in names; cache busting is at `v=39` in `app.js` while `base.html` is at `v=46`.
- `marked`, Chart.js, and d3.js loaded from CDN — undermines offline/local-first.
- Duplicated `parse_model_json()` patterns across `analysis.py`, `digest.py`, `preferences.py`.
- Two separate query paths (`/api/search` vs `/api/articles`) make combined semantic+filter UX hard.

**Test coverage**
- Zero automated tests. `playwright-tests/` contains 39 screenshot artifacts, no test code. Manual visual verification only.

## Phase 0 — Security & Integrity Release

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE — shipped as 0.2.0 (2026-07-03).** The section below is preserved as the executed plan of record; see README "From hackathon to 0.2.0" for what landed, and CLAUDE.md for the load-bearing conventions it introduced. Where details below drifted during execution (route shapes, exact mechanisms), CLAUDE.md and the code are current.

**Release target:** `0.2 alpha`
**Relative complexity:** XL
**Goal:** Make Tiro safe to install on a multi-device network, with a working data-lifecycle (delete, repair, recover), tested at the seams where current bugs live.

### Why this phase, why now

None of the product-grade distribution work should happen while any browser tab can mutate the user's Gmail credentials, hostile article HTML can run inside the app, or the only way to "delete" an article is to manually edit three databases and a directory. This is the prerequisite for everything else. The work also unlocks the planning of every later phase because adding new features on top of partial-state bugs is wasted effort.

The original review treated delete as Phase 1. We've moved it here because "local-first ownership" without delete is a product lie. The other Phase-1 items (source merge, advanced repair, full export) remain in Phase 1.

### In scope

**Authentication & origin protection** (the security spine):

- Single-user password auth: bcrypt-hashed password stored in `config.yaml` under `auth.password_hash`. First-run sets it. CLI command `tiro set-password` to reset.
- Session cookie (HttpOnly, Secure when over HTTPS, SameSite=Lax) for browser sessions. Sliding expiry, default 30 days.
- API token (random 32-byte URL-safe) for non-browser clients: Chrome extension, MCP server, CLI scripts. Stored hashed; presented once at creation. Multiple tokens supported.
- Lock down CORS in `tiro/app.py`: default `allow_origins` to `["http://localhost:8000", "http://127.0.0.1:8000"]`. Add token-listed origins for the Chrome extension (`chrome-extension://<id>`) configurable in `config.yaml`.
- CSRF protection for cookie-authenticated browser mutations: double-submit token or rely on SameSite=Lax + checking `Origin`/`Referer` headers. Pick one and document.
- LAN mode (`--lan`) must refuse to start without auth configured, unless explicit `--insecure-no-auth` is passed (with a startup warning printed every time).
- Chrome extension popup updates to handle token auth: settings tab to paste token, store in `chrome.storage.local`, send as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every request.
- MCP server (`tiro/mcp/server.py`) accepts token via env var `TIRO_API_TOKEN` (does not need to call API — it talks to SQLite/ChromaDB directly, but it should still respect the same single-user gating so misconfigured Desktop setups don't expose data via stale processes).

**Markdown sanitization** (XSS fix):

- Add DOMPurify (vendored, see "Vendor frontend deps" below) and run it after `marked.parse()` in both `tiro/frontend/static/reader.js` and `tiro/frontend/static/app.js`.
- Configure marked to disallow raw HTML where possible (`marked.setOptions({ ... })`).
- Sanitize again on the server during ingestion: strip `<script>`, `<iframe>`, event handlers, `javascript:` URLs from the saved markdown. Keep images, links, formatting.
- Apply the same sanitization to Opus-generated digest markdown before storing.

**Article deletion** (the product-credibility fix):

- New endpoint: `DELETE /api/articles/{id}`.
- New CLI: `tiro delete <id>` and `tiro delete --source <id>` (for bulk source delete in Phase 1; foundation here).
- Deletion must clean all stores: SQLite (`articles`, `article_tags`, `article_entities`, `article_relations`, `audio`), ChromaDB vector, markdown file under `articles/`, audio MP3 under `audio/`. Wrap in a single transaction-like coordinator with explicit rollback on failure (best-effort across non-transactional stores).
- Reader UI gets a delete button (with confirmation modal explaining permanence). Inbox gets keyboard shortcut `x` (after current selection) and bulk delete via checkbox + toolbar.
- Add SQLite foreign keys with `ON DELETE CASCADE` to junction tables in `tiro/database.py` where missing — but do not rely on them alone; the coordinator still handles markdown/ChromaDB/audio.

**Atomic ingestion** (the four-store consistency fix):

- Refactor `tiro/ingestion/processor.py` `process_article()` into explicit stages with rollback:
  1. Compute slug, check duplicate (read-only).
  2. Write markdown to temp file `articles/.{slug}.md.tmp`.
  3. Insert article + source rows in a single SQLite transaction. Capture article_id.
  4. `os.rename()` temp file to final path (atomic on POSIX).
  5. Call Haiku for tags/entities/summary.
  6. Update SQLite + frontmatter with extracted metadata.
  7. Add to ChromaDB. On failure, mark article with `vector_status='pending'` and continue (background retry).
  8. Compute related articles and store relations.
  9. Update stats (idempotent — see Stats below).
- On failure at any stage after the rename, the cleanup runs the same path as article deletion to leave no orphans.
- Add `articles.vector_status` column: `pending | indexed | failed`. Background task retries pending vectors every N minutes.

**`tiro doctor` repair command** (the recovery fix):

- New CLI: `tiro doctor` walks all four stores and reports inconsistencies.
- `tiro doctor --fix` performs repairs:
  - Markdown files without DB rows → move to `articles/.orphaned/` or delete with confirmation.
  - DB rows without markdown files → mark broken and offer deletion.
  - ChromaDB vectors with no matching article → delete.
  - Articles with no vector → re-embed.
  - Audio rows with missing MP3 → clean row.
  - MP3 files with no row → delete or re-register.
- Output is human-readable and machine-parseable (`--json` flag).

**Settings path correctness**:

- Store `config_path` on `app.state` during config load in `tiro/app.py`.
- Refactor `tiro/api/routes_settings.py` to use a shared `persist_config(state, updates)` helper that writes to the active path. Helper preserves comments and field order (use `ruamel.yaml` not stdlib `yaml`).
- Same fix for `tts`, `email`, `digest-schedule`, `appearance` settings.

**Stats idempotency**:

- In `tiro/api/routes_articles.py`, before incrementing read/rating stats, read the previous values.
- `articles_read` and `reading_time_minutes` increment only on the `is_read: 0 → 1` transition.
- `articles_rated` increments only on the `rating: NULL → not NULL` transition. Rating changes do not increment.
- Optional: rename to `rating_actions` if total writes are wanted somewhere — but the dashboard meaning is "articles you rated," so transition counting is correct.

**Dynamic IMAP scheduler**:

- Mirror the digest-scheduler pattern (`app.state.digest_task`): store `app.state.imap_task` and add start/stop logic to `tiro/api/routes_settings.py` when email settings change.
- When IMAP is enabled or `imap_sync_interval` changes, restart the task. When disabled, cancel it.
- An immediate check after enable is optional UX polish (toast + check fires).

**Vendor frontend dependencies** (local-first integrity):

- Move CDN libraries (`marked`, Chart.js, d3.js, DOMPurify) into `tiro/frontend/static/vendor/` with pinned versions. Add a short README documenting versions and upgrade procedure.
- Update `base.html` and `inbox.html`/`digest.html`/`reader.html`/`graph.html`/`stats.html` references.
- Add SRI hashes to any remaining CDN script tags. Strongly prefer none.

**Test harness bootstrap** (zero → minimum viable):

- Add `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `httpx` to dev deps in `pyproject.toml`.
- Create `tests/` directory with `conftest.py` providing fixtures: temp `library_path`, isolated SQLite, isolated ChromaDB, FastAPI `TestClient`.
- Required test coverage for this phase:
  - `tests/test_auth.py` — password hashing, session cookie, token validation, CORS rejection, CSRF.
  - `tests/test_ingestion.py` — happy path; failure at each stage leaves no orphans; duplicate URL handling.
  - `tests/test_delete.py` — create article, delete article, assert no residue in any store.
  - `tests/test_doctor.py` — seed inconsistencies, run doctor --fix, assert clean.
  - `tests/test_stats.py` — first-read transition increments; subsequent reads do not; rating-change does not double-count.
  - `tests/test_settings.py` — config writes go to the active `--config` path; YAML comments preserved.
  - `tests/test_sanitize.py` — `<script>` and `javascript:` URLs stripped from saved markdown and digest output.
  - `tests/test_smoke.py` — server starts, key endpoints respond authenticated, reject unauthenticated.
- One Playwright smoke test (in `playwright-tests/` as a real `.spec.js`, not a screenshot) verifying login, save article, read, delete.

### Out of scope

- Multi-user accounts (single-user only, this release).
- OAuth / SSO.
- Source merge, source rename, author normalization (Phase 1).
- Backup snapshots (Phase 1).
- Notes and highlights (Phase 1 follow-on, actually Phase 2 here).
- RSS, OPML (Phase 3).
- Desktop packaging (Phase 4).

### Dependencies

None. This is the foundation phase.

### Acceptance criteria

- Server refuses unauthenticated requests to any `/api/*` route except `POST /api/auth/login` and a `/healthz`.
- Hostile `<script>alert(1)</script>` saved in an article does not execute in the reader.
- `DELETE /api/articles/{id}` followed by `tiro doctor` reports zero inconsistencies.
- Crashing the server during `process_article()` and restarting leaves no orphans visible to `tiro doctor`.
- `uv run tiro --config /tmp/test.yaml run`, then changing TTS voice via the Settings UI, results in the new voice persisted in `/tmp/test.yaml` (not `./config.yaml`).
- Opening the same article ten times increments `articles_read` by 1, not 10.
- Enabling IMAP via Settings begins polling within one sync interval, without restart.
- `pytest` runs green; coverage report committed.
- All vendored deps work with the dev server offline (disconnect network, reload, verify).

### Test plan

- All unit/integration tests above.
- Manual Playwright run of: fresh install → set password → save URL → read → highlight → rate → delete → confirm gone.
- Run `tiro doctor` on the demo seed library, verify clean.
- LAN-mode integration test: start with `--lan`, attempt connection from a second device, confirm auth challenge.

### Risks and gotchas

- **DOMPurify config affects existing articles**: aggressive stripping may remove `<img>` width/height attributes used in reader styling. Test on the demo library before rolling out.
- **`marked` + DOMPurify ordering**: sanitize the HTML output, not the markdown input — sanitizing markdown breaks legitimate formatting.
- **ChromaDB rollback is best-effort**: ChromaDB has no transaction primitives. The coordinator should delete added vectors on failure but accept that a hard crash mid-`add()` can leave one orphan. `tiro doctor` is the safety net.
- **`ON DELETE CASCADE` requires pragma**: SQLite foreign keys are off by default. `tiro/database.py` already enables them in `get_connection()`, but every connection must do this — verify across the codebase.
- **Session cookie + Chrome extension**: extensions cannot share cookies with web pages by default. Extension uses bearer token, browser uses cookie. Two auth paths, one auth backend.
- **Stats idempotency may break the demo seed**: the seed script may rely on bumping counters. Update `scripts/seed_articles.py` to set state directly in SQL.
- **`config_path` change touches every settings handler**: easy to miss one. Grep for `Path("config.yaml")` after the refactor and assert zero hits.
- **CLAUDE.md warns about ChromaDB readonly DB errors in uvicorn** — pre-initializing the library with `tiro init` works around it. The atomic ingestion refactor must not regress this.

## Phase 1 — Local Library Integrity

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE — shipped as 0.3.0.** (M1.0 Foundation, M1.1 Backup & Portability, M1.2 Sources/Authors/Views + Docker.) Preserved as the executed plan of record; CLAUDE.md's conventions block is current where details drifted.

**Release target:** `0.3 local-beta`
**Relative complexity:** L
**Goal:** Make the local-first data promise credible end-to-end: rename, merge, restore, back up.

> **Amended 2026-07-03 — see "Decisions Made" #0:** pull a Dockerfile/compose and a minimal second AI provider (Ollama or OpenAI) forward into this phase, plus the post-Phase-0 review deferrals for its first commit.
>
> **Amended 2026-07-04 — see "Decisions Made" #7 and #8:** the phase now **opens with the Foundation Milestone (M1.0)** below, consolidated from the 2026-07-04 strategic code review, the AI-layer decisions, and the LLM-wiki design exploration (local reports: `docs/plans/2026-07-04-strategic-code-review.md`, `...-llm-wiki-design-exploration.md`). M1.0 is mostly mechanical (~agent-week) and is a prerequisite for everything else in this phase and Phase 1b.

### Foundation Milestone (M1.0) — first milestone of this phase

Infrastructure that every later phase builds on, landed as one milestone before feature work:

**Dev infrastructure:**
- **CI**: GitHub Actions workflow — `uv run pytest`, `ruff check` + `ruff format --check`, the Python 3.11 syntax gate. The repo is public AGPL with a CONTRIBUTING.md and currently has zero CI; this is the highest-leverage single hour in the codebase. (mypy optional as a non-blocking second job to start.)
- **Migration framework** (pulled forward from Phase 5): `tiro/migrations/` with versioned migrations, `tiro migrate` CLI, auto-backup before running. Phases 1–2 add six-plus tables; do not hand-ALTER them.
- **Cache-bust as a Jinja global** injected by `create_app` instead of the hand-bumped `?v=N` counter across templates.

**Data foundation:**
- **`uid` ULID columns on `articles`, `entities`, and `tags`** (integer PKs stay for joins; ULIDs become the stable external identity). Retrofit under a live sync protocol (7a) would be XL; adding them now is S. Wiki pages, sidecars, audio filenames, and export formats key on ULIDs from here on.
- **SQLite indexes** for the hot query patterns (articles list sort, junction lookups, sessions/api_tokens lookups) plus a generated/indexed `display_date` to replace unindexable `COALESCE(published_at, ingested_at)` sorts.
- **Data-access layer start**: one module owning the article-list SQL (currently duplicated ×4, with a fifth variant drifting in the MCP server). Full repository pattern not required — just kill the copies.

**AI layer (Decision #7):**
- **`llm_call()` chokepoint** in `tiro/ai.py` (or similar): all five call sites route through it; call sites request a *capability tier* (`heavy` | `light`), never a model name; config maps tiers to `(provider, model)`. JSON parsing/fence-stripping/error-handling live here once. Audit logging moves inside it.
- **Prompts as data**: templates move out of code into versioned template files so personas (Phase 6) and the wiki (Phase 1b) can treat prompts as content.
- **Backends**: `anthropic-api` (today's behavior), plus the minimal second API provider from Decision #0 (Ollama or OpenAI/Gemini), plus **agent-CLI backends** (`claude-cli`, `codex-cli`) per Decision #7 — subprocess `-p`-style invocation, JSON envelope parsing, settings-isolated spawn, install/login detection surfaced in Settings, plan-rate-limit errors handled gracefully. CLI backends default to the `heavy` tier only (spawn latency makes them wrong for batch extraction).
- **Fake-LLM test seam**: a scripted `llm_call` backend for tests, so the intelligence layer stops being tested only by its absence.
- **Extraction quality fixes** (wiki prerequisite, Decision #8): remove the 2,000-char truncation in Haiku extraction (summaries are the wiki's raw material); add entity canonicalization pass (dedupe "OpenAI"/"Open AI") on top of the new entity ULIDs.

**Scheduler & lifecycle:**
- **`PeriodicTask` scheduler registry** (pulled forward from Phase 4's RSS plan): one abstraction owning the IMAP, digest, and vector-retry loops (currently three ad-hoc `app.state.*_task` patterns). Wiki sync/lint (Phase 1b) and RSS (Phase 4) become registrations, not new copies.
- **`wiki/` reserved** in the library layout and included in the Phase 1 backup/export schema (see Decision #8 for its store semantics).
- **Phase-0 review deferrals** (from Decision #0): vector-metadata parity in `retry_pending_vectors`; audit-log the TTS mid-stream disconnect and `imap.search` raise paths.

**Explicitly deferred out of M1.0** (decided, not forgotten): the ChromaDB → sqlite-vec migration + chunked embeddings (decide at this phase's backup-design point, land before 7a — backup must export embeddings portably either way); the app.js/reader.js ES-module restructuring (lands at the start of Phase 2, before highlight anchoring).

### Why this phase, why now

Phase 0 made delete work. Phase 1 extends the data-lifecycle to the operations a user performs after they've lived with their library for months: "this source is actually the same as that source," "I changed my mind, restore that article," "I want to back up before doing something risky." Without these, the local library accumulates inconsistency that even `tiro doctor` cannot fix because the source-of-truth is ambiguous.

This phase also closes the export story (notes/highlights are not in it yet — they arrive in Phase 2). Backups precede notes intentionally: notes are higher stakes, and a user who has highlighted an article cares much more about not losing it.

### In scope

**Source management**:
- `DELETE /api/sources/{id}` — removes the source row and cascades to its articles (with confirmation in the UI showing the article count).
- `POST /api/sources/merge` body `{from: id, into: id}` — re-points all articles from one source to another, removes the orphaned source row.
- `PATCH /api/sources/{id}` body `{name, domain, email_sender, source_type}` — rename and edit. UI in Settings or a new `/sources` page.
- Author normalization: detect close matches across sources (same `email_sender` with different display names) and offer merge.

**Author-level VIP**:
- Extend VIP from source-only to author-aware. The `articles.author` field already exists (extracted from `<meta name="author">`); promote authors to first-class.
- New table `authors`: `id, name, canonical_name, is_vip, notes`. Junction `article_authors` for the N:M (some articles have multiple authors).
- Backfill from existing `articles.author` text; manual merge UI in `/sources` page tab for "Authors."
- VIP authors flagged independently from source VIP. A user can VIP "Matt Levine" without VIPing all of Bloomberg.
- Digest and decay weights factor in author VIP alongside source VIP.

**Saved inbox views**:
- The filter panel (Checkpoint 22) supports 11 facets. Add "Save current view as…" with a name; saved views appear in the sidebar under a "Views" section.
- New table `saved_views`: `id, name, filter_json, sort_mode, created_at, position`.
- Drag-to-reorder in the sidebar. Right-click to rename/delete.
- Examples a user would save: "Unread tech this week," "Loved AI articles," "VIP newsletters today," "Substack only, unread."

**Backup snapshots**:
- New CLI: `tiro backup --output ~/tiro-backups/{date}.tar.zst` — full library snapshot (markdown + SQLite + ChromaDB + config minus secrets + audio metadata, optionally including audio MP3s with `--include-audio`).
- New CLI: `tiro restore <snapshot>` — replaces current library after confirmation. Existing library moved to `tiro-library.bak.{ts}`.
- Automatic backup hook before destructive operations: source delete, bulk delete, reclassify-with-clear, restore. Stored under `~/.tiro/backups/auto/` with a configurable retention (default: keep last 10).
- New endpoint: `GET /api/backup/snapshots` — list snapshots with sizes and dates.

**Full export expansion**:
- Extend `tiro/export.py` to include: highlights (Phase 2 will populate), notes (Phase 2), digests (all dates), analyses (`ingenuity_analysis` column), audio metadata, graph nodes/edges, stats history.
- Add OPML export of all sources (forward-looking for Phase 3 RSS).
- Export format documented in a `tiro/export/SCHEMA.md` so importers can be built.

**Import**:
- `tiro import <snapshot>` reverses export. Conflict resolution: skip / overwrite / keep both (with suffix).
- Foundation for Phase 3 third-party imports (Pocket, Instapaper, Readwise) — they will use the same import infrastructure.

### Out of scope

- Notes and highlights (Phase 2).
- RSS subscriptions (Phase 3).
- Cloud sync (Phase 6).
- Multi-device merge (Phase 6).

### Dependencies

- Phase 0 complete: delete must work, atomic ingestion must work, `tiro doctor` must work.

### Acceptance criteria

- `tiro backup` produces a snapshot; `tiro restore` of that snapshot on a wiped library produces an identical state (verified by hashing markdown files + diffing SQLite dumps).
- Merging source A into source B leaves zero references to A in any table.
- `tiro export` round-trips through `tiro import` with no data loss.
- All operations covered by tests; `tiro doctor` clean after each.

### Test plan

- `tests/test_backup.py` — backup, wipe, restore, assert identity.
- `tests/test_source_merge.py` — merge with overlapping articles and dedup.
- `tests/test_export_roundtrip.py` — full library → export → import → diff.
- Manual UI test of source delete confirmation, source merge UI.

### Risks and gotchas

- **ChromaDB is not portable across versions**. Backup must export embeddings as a portable format (JSON of `id, embedding, metadata`) and re-add them on restore, not copy ChromaDB's internal SQLite. This was already a sore point — see `CLAUDE.md` "ChromaDB readonly database" note.
- **Audio MP3s are large**. Default backup excludes them; opt-in only.
- **Source merge across `source_type`** (web vs email) is ambiguous — same author publishes blog and newsletter. Force user to pick the target type.
- **Restore must invalidate caches** — digest cache, audio cache, analysis cache. Cleanest: clear all caches on restore.

## Phase 1b — Library Wiki (MVP)

**Status: ✅ W1 SHIPPED as 0.3.5** (on-demand generation, mark-stale, mandatory citations). W2 (nightly sync + digest knowledge-diff) and W3 (lint) remain future ad-hoc features per Decision #8; W4 (wiki maintainers) re-homes into Phase 6 personas.

**Release target:** `0.3.5 wiki-alpha`
**Relative complexity:** M
**Goal:** Ship the first cut of the LLM-maintained wiki: on-demand synthesis pages over the user's library, compiled and owned by the LLM, browsable from the knowledge graph.

> Full design: `docs/plans/2026-07-04-llm-wiki-design-exploration.md` (local). Strategic rationale: Decision #8. Inspired by Karpathy's LLM-wiki pattern; his own framing — "room here for an incredible new product instead of a hacky collection of scripts" — is the positioning: Tiro already ships every piece of that stack except the compiled-wiki middle layer.

### Why this phase, why now

Per-item summaries are commoditized (Decision #0); cross-document synthesis is Tiro's position. The wiki is that position made concrete: entity/concept pages that compound as the library grows, turning the knowledge graph from a visualization into a destination. It lands directly after Phase 1 because M1.0 provides everything it needs (`llm_call`, ULIDs, scheduler registry, extraction fixes, `wiki/` in the export schema) and because the MVP cut is deliberately zero-background-cost, zero-compounding-risk — the trust problem is designed out before automation is added.

### In scope (the W1 cut)

- `{library}/wiki/` of LLM-generated markdown pages (entity/concept kinds first), ULID-keyed frontmatter, Obsidian-compatible `[[wikilinks]]`, **mandatory citations** back to source articles on every claim.
- **On-demand generation only**: a wiki page is created/refreshed when the user asks — from a knowledge-graph node click or a `/wiki/{slug}` view. No background synthesis in W1.
- `wiki/index.md` + `wiki/log.md` maintained on every generation (Karpathy's bookkeeping layer; also the human-auditable trail).
- `wiki/_schema.md` — the user-editable schema/instructions document injected into generation prompts (Layer 3; doubles as the future wiki-maintainer persona prompt).
- **Staleness is mark-only**: new/deleted articles flip a cheap `stale` flag on affected pages (computable from the existing entity/tag junctions); stale pages show a badge and a one-click regenerate. No auto-regeneration.
- **Trust rules (non-negotiable, from the design report)**: page updates consume article *summaries* + the prior page only — the wiki never reads the wiki (no compounding-error loops); sources stay immutable; regenerate-from-scratch always available per page and library-wide; wiki markdown renders through the same marked→DOMPurify path as digests (M3 invariant extends to it).
- **Trust-weighted synthesis**: generation prompts include per-source rating/VIP/decay signals so pages weight what the user has vetted (the Tiro-native differentiator).
- MCP: `get_wiki_page`, `list_wiki_pages` tools.
- Store semantics (decided): the wiki is a **files-as-truth fifth artifact** — backed up and exported (it embodies user-directed work), SQLite holds only a derived index, `tiro doctor` reconciles the index but never deletes pages.

### Out of scope (deferred to later waves)

- **W2** — nightly incremental sync (scheduled Haiku batch over stale pages, ~$1–3/mo posture) + the digest gaining a "what changed in your knowledge" wiki-diff section. Lands once W1 pages prove trustworthy.
- **W3** — lint: contradiction detection, orphan pages, missing-concept proposals, and lint-proposes-next-reads (the wiki suggesting what to save next — library becomes self-extending under explicit user acceptance).
- **W4** — wiki maintainers (ingester/linter/synthesizer) folded into the Phase 6 persona/plugin system.
- Reading-telemetry-driven importance scoring (see Decision #8 — signals land in Phase 2, the model later).
- Synthetic-data/finetuning on the library (parked 7b-era north star).

### Dependencies

- Phase 1 M1.0 complete: `llm_call()` + tiers, prompts-as-data, ULIDs on entities/tags, extraction truncation fix + entity canonicalization (dirty entities would poison pages — hard prerequisite), scheduler registry (W2), `wiki/` in export schema.

### Acceptance criteria

- Clicking a graph node with ≥2 linked articles offers/renders a wiki page whose every claim carries a citation resolving to a saved article.
- Saving a new article touching an existing page's entity marks it stale within one ingest cycle; regeneration incorporates it.
- Deleting an article leaves no dangling citations after regeneration; `tiro doctor` reports wiki-index drift without touching page files.
- `wiki/` round-trips through backup/export/import; hand-deleting the whole directory and regenerating from scratch produces a coherent wiki.
- A hostile string in an article title/summary does not execute when the wiki page renders.

### Risks and gotchas

- **A subtly-wrong wiki is worse than none** — it erodes the exact trust the product sells. The W1 posture (on-demand, cited, human-triggered) is the mitigation; do not let W2 automation creep in early.
- **Cost surprise**: generation is user-triggered Opus/heavy-tier; show cost estimates (audit-log pricing table) in the UI before bulk operations ("regenerate all").
- **Entity quality is the ceiling**: if canonicalization misses duplicates, the wiki fragments. Watch `tiro doctor`-style metrics on entity dedupe before enabling W2.

## Phase 2 — Highlights & Notes

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE — shipped as 0.4.0** (M2.0 frontend modularization, M2.1 sidecar backend, M2.2 reader annotation UI, M2.3 telemetry + Obsidian-compatible mode + digest highlight recap).

**Release target:** `0.4 reader-memory-beta`
**Relative complexity:** L
**Goal:** Make Tiro a place to think, not just a place to save.

### Why this phase, why now

Highlights and notes create the retention loop. A user who has highlighted ten articles will not switch readers; a user who has only saved them will. Every other phase below benefits from this existing (RSS items become highlight-worthy; agent runtime gets a new corpus to summarize; cloud sync becomes meaningfully personal).

This phase comes before desktop packaging (Phase 5) because packaging an app whose feature surface has not changed since 0.3 will not move adoption. Notes + highlights make the desktop install worth doing.

### In scope

**Data model**:
- New table `highlights`: `id, article_id, quote_text, prefix_context, suffix_context, text_position_start, text_position_end, content_hash, color, created_at, updated_at`.
- New table `notes`: `id, article_id, highlight_id (nullable), body_markdown, created_at, updated_at`.
- `highlight_id NULL` means article-level note; otherwise it is anchored to a highlight.
- Sidecar files (source of truth for portability):
  - `notes/{slug}.md` — user's article-level notes in markdown.
  - `annotations/{slug}.jsonl` — one annotation per line: `{id, quote, prefix, suffix, position, hash, color, note_id, timestamps}`. SQLite is a derived index, not the source of truth.
- On startup, reconcile sidecars → SQLite (sidecars win on conflict).

**Reader UI**:
- Text selection in the reader pops a toolbar: highlight (color picker: yellow, green, blue, pink), add note, copy quote.
- Highlights persist visually on reload using `Range` reconstruction from anchors.
- Margin notes panel: clicking a highlight opens its note (or creates one).
- Article-level note: button in reader header, opens drawer.
- Notes are markdown with live preview.

**Anchor robustness** (the hard problem):
- Primary anchor: surrounding text (prefix + selected quote + suffix), per W3C Annotation Model TextQuoteSelector pattern.
- Secondary anchor: text position offset within the article markdown.
- Tertiary anchor: content hash of article markdown (detects drift).
- Reconciliation order on load: text-quote match → position fallback → hash-mismatch warning shown to user with "find similar text" UI.

**Highlight review**:
- New view `/highlights` showing all highlights, filterable by article/source/color/date.
- "Highlight digest" — extend digest generation to include a weekly highlight summary section.
- Keyboard shortcut `h` opens highlight view.

**Export/import**:
- Highlights and notes included in `tiro export` (Phase 1 expansion already planned this).
- Markdown export option: append highlights as blockquotes under article frontmatter for Obsidian compatibility.

**MCP exposure**:
- New tool `get_highlights` in `tiro/mcp/server.py` — agents can read user highlights as context.

**Scroll depth and reading-session instrumentation**:
- The reader already calls `mark_read` on load. Extend with fine-grained engagement signal:
  - `max_scroll_depth_pct` (0–100) — captured throughout the session.
  - `active_seconds` — accumulated only while the tab is visible and the user is interacting.
  - `dwell_per_section` — JSON array of `{heading, seconds}` keyed off article H2/H3 anchors.
- New table `reading_sessions`: `id, article_id, started_at, ended_at, max_scroll_pct, active_seconds, dwell_json`. One row per reading session, multiple per article.
- Sent from the reader as a single `PATCH /api/articles/{id}/session` on `visibilitychange→hidden` or `beforeunload`; debounced to avoid network churn.
- Feed into Phase 6 preference classifier as a richer signal than the current binary read/unread.
- Strictly local; never transmitted off-device unless cloud sync is opted in.
- **These signals are also the wiki's importance/trust input (Decision #8)**: %-read, active seconds, likes, and favorited authors let wiki synthesis weight what the user actually engaged with, not just what they hoarded — the primary defense against a poisoned/noisy wiki. Longer-term (post-Phase-6): an opt-in, **locally-running lightweight importance model** trained on these signals (ratings + engagement + VIP as labels) scores articles/claims continuously; the score feeds wiki page weighting and digest ranking. Local inference only (same posture as the sentence-transformers embeddings); never a cloud call.

**Obsidian-vault compatibility** (on-disk format only — bidirectional sync is now Phase 7a's first milestone, née Phase 2b):
- New config flag: `obsidian_compatible_mode: bool`. When true:
  - Article frontmatter uses Obsidian-friendly fields (`tags:` as YAML list, `aliases:`, `created:`).
  - Inline `[[wikilinks]]` for related articles (instead of `/articles/{id}` URLs).
  - Notes sidecars use the same naming convention as the article (`notes/{slug}.md`).
  - Optional: point `library_path` at an existing Obsidian vault subdirectory.
- Does not require Obsidian to be installed; just lays out files so Obsidian opens them cleanly if the user wants.
- This phase ships the read-friendly format; **the file-watcher and bidirectional reconciliation** that make Obsidian a co-equal editing surface ship as the sync engine's first milestone (Phase 7a S1 — the absorbed Phase 2b, see Decision #9).

### Out of scope

- Spaced repetition / flashcards (post-1.0 unless explicit user demand).
- Highlight sharing or social features.
- AI-generated highlight suggestions (Phase 6 agent runtime could add this).
- Voice notes (post-1.0).

### Dependencies

- Phase 0 complete (sanitization required — highlights contain user-written markdown that gets rendered).
- Phase 1 complete (export schema must accommodate highlights/notes).

### Acceptance criteria

- Highlight a paragraph, reload, highlight persists.
- Edit the article markdown by hand, reload — highlight either re-anchors (if quote still present) or surfaces a warning (if not).
- Notes are markdown-editable and rendered safely.
- Sidecar files in `notes/` and `annotations/` are human-readable.
- Round-trip: export → wipe → import preserves all highlights and notes.

### Test plan

- `tests/test_highlights.py` — anchor reconciliation: exact, position-only, hash-mismatch, missing.
- `tests/test_notes.py` — markdown sanitization, sidecar/DB sync.
- Playwright: select text → highlight → reload → assert highlight present at same location.
- Manual: hand-edit a `notes/` sidecar; restart server; assert SQLite picks up the change.

### Risks and gotchas

- **Reader currently re-renders markdown to HTML on every load**. Highlights apply to the *rendered DOM*, not the markdown. Must use a deterministic markdown → HTML render so positions are stable, or render once and cache the HTML alongside the article.
- **DOMPurify (Phase 0) strips some attributes**. If we add `data-highlight-id` attributes to spans, allowlist them.
- **Hash drift from upstream updates**: if a user re-saves an article and it changed, do we re-anchor highlights from the old version? Decision: no — version the article, keep highlights pinned to the version they were made against, surface a "newer version available" UI.
- **`Range` reconstruction across DOM types**: highlights spanning element boundaries (e.g. across a `<p>` break) need careful range serialization. Use [rangy](https://github.com/timdown/rangy) or equivalent, vendored.

## Phase 2b — Obsidian Bidirectional Sync

**Status: ⤳ ABSORBED INTO PHASE 7a (2026-07-06, Decision #9) — no longer a standalone phase.** The 2026-07-06 sync-engine design (local planning docs) delivers everything below as the sync engine's first milestone (S1, "local reconcile engine"), so external Obsidian edits and multi-device sync share one merge core and one conflict-file semantic instead of two overlapping reconciliation implementations. This section is preserved as the requirements source for that milestone; the `0.4.5` release target is retired.

**Release target:** `0.4.5 obsidian-beta`
**Relative complexity:** L
**Goal:** Make Obsidian a co-equal editing surface for the Tiro library. Edits in either tool reconcile cleanly into the other.

### Why this phase, why now

Phase 2 ships the on-disk format that Obsidian can read. Phase 2b ships the live reconciliation that makes it actually useful: an Obsidian user can highlight in Tiro on their laptop, open the same vault in Obsidian on their tablet to write a longer note in Obsidian's editor, and have Tiro pick up the new note text on next read without losing the highlight anchors.

This is a commitment, not a "maybe" — Obsidian is the closest neighboring product to Tiro, and the user base overlaps heavily. Treating Obsidian as a peer instead of a competitor differentiates Tiro from every other read-it-later app on the market.

Sequencing rationale: this lands immediately after Phase 2 because (a) the on-disk format is fresh in everyone's mind, (b) users who care about highlights are the same users who care about Obsidian, and (c) it predates desktop packaging (Phase 5) so the file-watcher behavior is battle-tested before it ships in a service-managed daemon.

### In scope

**File watcher**:
- Watch `library_path` for changes using `watchdog` (cross-platform).
- Trigger debounced reconciliation on file create/modify/delete events.
- Throttle: skip Tiro-originated writes (mark them in a short-lived "expect this change" set so we don't re-process our own work).

**Reconciliation engine**:
- On external article-markdown edit: re-parse frontmatter, update SQLite metadata, re-embed if body changed, re-anchor highlights against the new content using Phase 2's anchor reconciliation (text-quote first, position fallback, hash-mismatch surfacing).
- On external notes-sidecar edit: replace the SQLite-derived index, re-render anywhere the note is shown.
- On external annotations.jsonl edit: replace annotation set; surface drift warnings if Obsidian-side edits broke the JSONL format (the user might have hand-edited).
- On external file delete: do not delete the SQLite row immediately. Move article to a "trash" view; surface a "did you mean to delete this in Tiro too?" prompt.
- On external file create within `articles/`: ingest as a manual article (no URL, no source — treat as a "imported from Obsidian" article with `ingestion_method='external'`).

**Conflict resolution**:
- Tiro writes use a content hash; if a Tiro write is about to overwrite a file whose hash doesn't match Tiro's last-known hash, treat as conflict.
- Conflict UI: show both versions, let user pick or merge. Keep losing version as `{slug}.conflict-{ts}.md` so nothing is destroyed.
- For notes: prefer Obsidian's version as winner when ambiguous (Obsidian's strength is the editor; users will assume their writing wins).

**Vault discovery and pairing**:
- New setup flow at `/setup/obsidian`: detect existing Obsidian vaults (`~/Documents/`, `~/Obsidian/`, common patterns); offer to set `library_path` to an existing vault, or to a subdirectory of one.
- Migration tool: convert an existing Tiro library into an Obsidian-compatible layout in place, preserving all data.
- Reverse migration: convert an Obsidian vault Tiro is managing into a standalone library if the user wants to move out.

**Wiki-link resolution**:
- Inline `[[Article Title]]` links work in both directions. Tiro renders them as internal links; Obsidian renders them via its native wikilink system.
- Cross-file references (article → note → article) preserved through both editors.

**Performance**:
- File watcher does not re-embed on every keystroke. Debounce at 2-3 seconds of file stability.
- Skip re-embed if only frontmatter changed (no body change).
- Bulk reconciliation mode: a one-shot "scan and reconcile everything" CLI for libraries that have been edited externally while Tiro was off (`tiro reconcile`).

### Out of scope

- Obsidian plugin (a Tiro-native Obsidian plugin that talks to the running Tiro server). Worth considering post-1.0 but the file-format approach is the more durable interoperability story.
- Real-time collaborative editing within Obsidian. Tiro is single-user.
- Migrating Obsidian's own metadata (graph, aliases, canvas, etc.) into Tiro semantics. Obsidian's metadata stays Obsidian's; Tiro only reads its own frontmatter and the markdown body.

### Dependencies

- Phase 2 complete (highlights, notes, sidecar format, Obsidian-vault compatibility mode).
- Phase 0 sanitization (external markdown edits go through the same sanitization pipeline).

### Acceptance criteria

- An Obsidian user can open Tiro's library as their vault, edit a note from Obsidian, save, switch to Tiro, see the updated note within seconds without restart.
- Editing the same note in Tiro and Obsidian while one is offline produces a conflict file, not data loss.
- Hand-deleting an article file in Obsidian moves the article to Tiro's trash view; restoring it from trash recreates the file.
- Adding a new markdown file to `articles/` outside Tiro causes it to appear in the inbox as an external-source article.
- Running `tiro reconcile` after a week of Obsidian-only edits brings the SQLite state consistent with the filesystem in a single pass.

### Test plan

- `tests/test_watcher.py` — file events trigger correct reconciliation; Tiro-originated writes don't loop.
- `tests/test_conflict.py` — concurrent edit scenarios produce conflict files, never silent data loss.
- `tests/test_external_create.py` — new files appear as external articles.
- `tests/test_reconcile.py` — bulk reconcile correctness on a synthetic divergent state.
- Manual: actual Obsidian session, edit in both, verify both sides.

### Risks and gotchas

- **Watcher loops are easy to write and brutal to debug**. Every Tiro write must mark itself in the "expect this change" set *before* the write happens, not after.
- **Cross-platform file events differ**. macOS aggregates rapid changes; Linux fires per-event; Windows has its own quirks. `watchdog` papers over most but not all. Test on all three.
- **Obsidian writes atomically by default** (write to temp, rename) — the watcher must handle both create and rename events as "file changed."
- **Frontmatter drift**: Obsidian users will hand-edit frontmatter in ways Tiro doesn't expect (custom fields, reordered keys, multi-line values). Preserve unknown fields; never strip them on round-trip.
- **Embeddings re-cost**: re-embedding on every external edit can be expensive. The "frontmatter-only change = skip re-embed" optimization is mandatory, not optional.
- **Locking on `library_path` shared with active Obsidian editor**: Obsidian holds open file handles. Tiro writes must tolerate transient lock errors and retry.

## Phase 3 — Private Remote Access

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE — shipped and tagged `v0.5.0` (2026-07-06)** (M3.0 remote backend: snooze, QR login, mDNS, TLS flags; M3.1 PWA: manifest, service worker, offline save queue, `/setup/remote` wizard; M3.2 swipe-triage inbox: gestures, undo, inbox zero). Real-device verification remains an owner checklist item.

**Release target:** `0.5 private-remote-beta`
**Relative complexity:** M
**Goal:** Let users run Tiro on a laptop or home machine and read it from their phone without giving up local ownership.

> **Amended 2026-07-03 — see "Decisions Made" #0:** this phase's priority is elevated (mobile is the field's biggest gap vs Tiro), and a native SwiftUI iPhone client should be dispatched right after it ships — as a companion to, not a replacement for, the PWA here or Phase 5's desktop packaging.

### Why this phase, why now

This is the product wedge. "Read on phone while the library stays on your machine" is the killer use case that distinguishes local-first from cloud-first readers. It is also the natural bridge to paid Tiro Cloud: users who don't want to manage Tailscale can pay for hosted access.

The phase is sequenced after highlights because highlighting on a phone is the actual mobile UX worth building. Without highlights, the phone experience is a read-only viewer — much less compelling.

This is a Medium-complexity phase, not Large: most of it is a setup wizard plus PWA manifest work on top of features that already exist.

### In scope

**Private Remote setup wizard** (`/setup/remote` in the web UI):
- Detect Tailscale presence: `tailscale status --json` via subprocess.
- If installed: show the `tailscale serve` command tailored to the current Tiro port. Optional: execute it on the user's confirmation.
- Store the resulting Tailscale URL in config (`remote_url`).
- Test reachability: HEAD request from the server to itself via the Tailscale URL.
- If Tailscale is not installed: link to installation instructions, show an alternative manual port-forwarding warning.

**LAN-mode hardening**:
- `--lan` now requires auth (already enforced by Phase 0).
- Startup prints the LAN IP, the auth URL, and a warning that unencrypted HTTP is in use unless behind Tailscale/HTTPS.
- A persistent banner in the UI when bound to `0.0.0.0` without HTTPS, dismissable per-session.

**QR code login**:
- `/setup/qr` generates a QR code containing the Tiro URL + one-time login token (15-minute TTL).
- Scanning it on a phone opens the URL, validates the token, logs in, stores a session cookie. Token is single-use.

**Mobile PWA polish**:
- `tiro/frontend/static/manifest.webmanifest` with name, icons (use existing logo), `display: standalone`, theme colors from active theme.
- Service worker (`tiro/frontend/static/sw.js`) caching: shell HTML/CSS/JS + recently-viewed article markdown for offline reading.
- "Add to Home Screen" prompt UX.
- Reader: tap-target sizing, swipe-back gesture, thumb-friendly audio controls, persistent mini-player on scroll.
- Inbox: pull-to-refresh, infinite scroll already exists.
- Offline article queue: if a save fails (no network), queue locally and retry when online.

**Swipe-triage inbox** (the inbox-zero loop from the product vision):
- Slack-catch-up-style triage on mobile: swipe right on an inbox card to archive (mark read), swipe left to snooze (read later), with a long-swipe or action sheet exposing rate (dislike/like/love) and VIP.
- Undo toast after every gesture (5-second window) — triage must feel fast and safe.
- Triage progress indicator ("14 to zero") with a satisfying inbox-zero end state.
- Desktop analog already exists (j/k + 1/2/3 keyboard flow); this phase makes the two flows share the same underlying mark-read/snooze semantics. Snooze is new: `articles.snoozed_until` timestamp, snoozed articles hidden from inbox until then.
- Touch implementation: pointer-events-based swipe with CSS transform feedback, no external gesture library.

**HTTPS guidance**:
- Tailscale Serve provides HTTPS automatically. Document this as the recommended path.
- For LAN-only setups, document mkcert and provide a `tiro run --cert <path> --key <path>` option.
- Do not generate self-signed certs automatically (UX nightmare).

**mDNS / Bonjour discovery** (for LAN-only users who don't want Tailscale):
- Use `python-zeroconf` to advertise `tiro.local` (or a user-configurable hostname) on the LAN at startup.
- Phones on the same Wi-Fi find Tiro by name; no IP memorization, no DNS setup.
- Works out of the box on iOS/macOS; Android requires the user to install a Bonjour browser app or use the IP fallback (documented).
- Settings page shows the active `.local` hostname plus a QR code encoding the URL.
- Disabled by default in cloud/container environments where mDNS is noisy or unwanted; opt-in via `mdns_enabled: bool`.

### Out of scope

- Public sharing (Tailscale Funnel) — document as advanced, do not build wizard.
- Native iOS/Android apps (PWA only this phase).
- Multi-device merge (Phase 6 cloud sync).
- WebAuthn / passkeys (post-1.0 unless user demand).

### Dependencies

- Phase 0 (auth, sanitization).
- Highlights (Phase 2) — phone is most valuable when it supports highlighting.

### Acceptance criteria

- A user with Tailscale on laptop + phone can run `tiro run`, complete the setup wizard, open the URL on their phone via Tailscale, log in via QR, save an article from the phone, highlight on the phone, and have it appear on the laptop within one refresh.
- LAN mode without auth refuses to start unless `--insecure-no-auth` passed.
- Service worker enables reading the last 50 articles offline on a phone with the app installed.

### Test plan

- Integration test for the QR login flow (token TTL, single-use).
- Manual cross-device test with two laptops on the same Tailscale tailnet.
- Lighthouse PWA audit ≥ 90.
- Manual offline test: install PWA, go offline, read previously-viewed article.

### Risks and gotchas

- **Tailscale is not always in `$PATH`** for the user running `uvicorn`. Detection must handle absence cleanly.
- **Subprocess call to `tailscale serve` requires elevated permissions** on some platforms. Show the command, do not always execute it.
- **Service worker cache invalidation** intersects with the `v=N` cache busting pattern in `base.html`. Update the SW to use the same version stamp.
- **The session cookie set on Tailscale URL is scoped to that hostname** — moving between Tailscale URL and direct LAN URL means re-auth. Document this.

## Phase 4 — Recurring Ingestion (RSS + Imports)

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE — shipped and tagged `v0.6.0` (2026-07-10).** RSS/Atom subscriptions (conditional GETs, per-feed backoff, hostile-feed isolation), OPML import/export, the `/feeds` management page, and Readwise/Instapaper/Omnivore importers with server-side highlight anchoring (unlocatable quotes skip-with-count, never hand-placed). Also shipped: the Chrome-extension advanced save (context menu + save-with-selection-as-highlight + save-all-tabs), the `PeriodicTask` scheduler registry (unifying the IMAP/digest/vector-retry loops), and — from the owner UX wave — the reading-progress bar and unread-first inbox with a distinct Library view. Preserved below as the executed plan of record; CLAUDE.md's Phase 4 conventions are current where details drifted. Pocket importer dropped (dead format, Decision #0); forwarding-address email deferred to a documented plus-addressing recipe.

**Release target:** `0.6 feeds-beta`
**Relative complexity:** M
**Goal:** Make Tiro useful every morning without manual saving; bring users in via importable libraries from competing tools.

> **Amended 2026-07-03 — see "Decisions Made" #0:** the Pocket importer below is stale (Pocket shut down in 2025); re-aim importers at Readwise/Instapaper/Omnivore-zip refugees and add forwarding-address email ingestion.

### Why this phase, why now

Two unrelated reasons grouped because they share infrastructure:

1. **Recurring ingestion (RSS/OPML)** creates daily return value. The current model requires the user to remember to save things; RSS makes the library fill itself overnight. Small engineering effort (a `feeds` table + `feedparser` + the existing scheduler pattern), high recurring value.

2. **Third-party imports (Pocket, Instapaper, Readwise)** are the acquisition channel. People with 5,000 Pocket items will try Tiro the day Pocket dies — or any day they decide to leave. Without an importer Tiro starts every user at zero.

Both build on Phase 1's import infrastructure.

### In scope

**RSS / Atom**:
- New table `feeds`: `id, url, title, last_fetched_at, last_etag, last_modified, status, error_count, source_id, fetch_interval_minutes`.
- New module `tiro/ingestion/rss.py` using `feedparser`.
- Background task in lifespan: `_rss_sync_loop()`, mirrors IMAP scheduler pattern. Per-feed `fetch_interval_minutes` (default 60).
- Feed entries flow through the same `process_article()` path. Use `link` as URL, `published_parsed` as `published_at`, feed title as source.
- Dedup by `entry.id` or canonical URL.
- Conditional GETs: send `If-None-Match` (etag) and `If-Modified-Since`.

**OPML**:
- `POST /api/feeds/import` accepts OPML file upload.
- `GET /api/feeds/export` returns OPML of all subscribed feeds.

**Feed management UI** (`/feeds`):
- List subscribed feeds with last-fetch, status, recent article count, pause toggle.
- Add feed by URL (with autodiscovery via `<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">`).
- Per-feed: fetch interval, mute, delete (with cascade option for its articles).

**Third-party imports**:
- `tiro import-pocket <export.html>` — Pocket's official HTML export.
- `tiro import-instapaper <export.csv>` — Instapaper CSV export.
- `tiro import-readwise <export.json>` — Readwise/Reader export.
- Each maps: URL → article (re-fetch and re-extract), tags → tags, highlights → highlights (Phase 2!), notes → notes (Phase 2!).
- Imports run in background with progress reporting.

**Advanced extension save**:
- Chrome extension: right-click context menu for "Save to Tiro" with submenus (Save, Save as VIP, Save with selection-as-highlight).
- Selection save: if the user has text selected, save the article and pre-create a highlight on that selection.
- Save-all-tabs button.

> **Twitter / X thread connector** has been deferred to post-1.0 — see Cross-Cutting "Rich Media & Social Connectors." X's anti-scraping environment makes connector maintenance expensive, and the value-per-engineering-week is lower than RSS, Pocket import, or PDFs.

### Out of scope

- PDF ingestion (Phase 7).
- YouTube transcripts (Phase 7).
- Podcast transcription (Phase 7).
- Reverse-direction sync (Tiro → Readwise) — post-1.0.

### Dependencies

- Phase 1 (import schema).
- Phase 2 (so imports can carry highlights).
- IMAP scheduler pattern (already in `tiro/app.py`).

### Acceptance criteria

- Subscribing to 10 RSS feeds and waiting one cycle results in new articles ingested with correct sources and publish dates.
- OPML import of an exported feed list reproduces the same subscriptions.
- A Pocket export with 100 articles imports successfully, with re-fetched markdown and original timestamps.
- A Readwise export with 50 highlights imports highlights anchored correctly to articles.
- Feed errors do not stop other feeds; failure count and last error visible in `/feeds`.

### Test plan

- `tests/test_rss.py` — etag/last-modified handling, dedup, error backoff.
- `tests/test_opml.py` — round-trip.
- `tests/test_importers.py` — each importer with a small fixture file.
- Integration test: subscribe to a local test feed (served by `pytest` fixture), assert poll → article appears.

### Risks and gotchas

- **`feedparser` has security advisories around malformed feeds**. Pin a current version, fuzz with a few hostile feeds.
- **Re-fetching imported Pocket articles will fail for paywalled content**. Fall back to saving the Pocket extract if available; otherwise store as a stub with the original URL.
- **OPML nested folder structure** is common — flatten or preserve as tag prefixes? Recommendation: flatten on import, surface folder names as auto-tags.
- **RSS items often duplicate web saves**. Dedup by canonical URL across `articles.url` regardless of ingestion method.

## Phase 5 — Installable Personal App

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE — shipped and tagged `v0.7.0` (2026-07-10).** PyInstaller-frozen full server (offline-capable, bundled embedding model), a Tauri desktop shell managing the server as a sidecar (random free port, healthz poll, orphan-free shutdown), the `/welcome` first-run onboarding wizard, platform-default library paths with a copy-never-move migration, migrate-on-start hardening, a notify-only GitHub update check, the `tiro service` CLI (launchd/systemd), and a multi-arch ghcr Docker workflow. **Owner-gated steps remain a runbook, not executed** (`docs/RUNBOOK-desktop.md`): macOS Developer ID signing + notarization, first ghcr push (auto-fires on the tag, needs the package made public), real-device launchd/window verification, Homebrew tap fast-follow. Auto-update/rollback was scoped down to notify-only for this beta (owner Decision ON-9). Preserved below as the executed plan of record; CLAUDE.md's Phase 5 conventions are current where details drifted.

**Release target:** `0.7 desktop-beta`
**Relative complexity:** L
**Goal:** Make Tiro easy for non-technical users to install, run continuously, and update.

> **Amended 2026-07-03 — see "Decisions Made" #0:** the native SwiftUI iPhone client dispatched after Phase 3 does not replace this phase — they are different products (this phase packages the Python server itself). The Docker deliverable below may partially land early via the Phase 1 pull-forward.

### Why this phase, why now

By 0.7 the feature surface (auth, delete, notes, RSS, private remote) is worth installing. Before now, packaging would have been "the same demo, easier to install" — pure cost-of-distribution with no demand pull.

This phase deliberately follows highlights and RSS because both are daily-return loops that justify the install. Packaging precedes Tiro Cloud because the desktop install creates the user base that Cloud later serves.

### In scope

**Default library location**:
- Move default from `./tiro-library` to platform-appropriate paths:
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Tiro/`
  - Linux: `~/.local/share/tiro/`
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Tiro\`
- `tiro init` writes config with the platform default. Existing installs migrate on next launch with confirmation.
- Backup auto-snapshots go under `<library>/backups/auto/`.

**Desktop packaging** (Tauri recommended):
- Tauri wrapper around the existing FastAPI server. On launch: starts the server on a random free local port, opens a Tauri window pointing at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`.
- Bundle Python via PyInstaller or PyOxidizer-equivalent; ship a single signed binary per platform.
- App icon, menu bar (preferences, quit), about dialog.
- macOS notarization, Windows code signing (the latter is a separate procurement track).

**Background service management**:
- macOS: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tiro.app.plist` written by `tiro service install`.
- Linux: systemd user unit, `tiro service install` writes `~/.config/systemd/user/tiro.service`.
- Windows: scheduled task or service via `nssm` documented (not bundled).
- `tiro service uninstall`, `tiro service status`, `tiro service logs`.

**Auto-update**:
- Tauri's built-in updater pointed at a JSON manifest hosted on the project's release infrastructure (TBD: GitHub Releases is the obvious default).
- On update: stop service, replace binary, run any migrations (`tiro migrate`), restart service.
- Roll-back on failed startup (preserve previous binary as `tiro.app.previous`).

**First-run onboarding** (the most important UX):
- Welcome → library location → auth password → AI provider choice (Anthropic / OpenAI / local / none) → API key entry → optional email setup → optional Tailscale setup → Chrome extension install link → seed sample articles offer.
- Each step skippable; defaults sane.

**Distribution channels**:
- `uvx tiro` for technical users — already works via `pip install tiro`.
- PyPI release with semver tags.
- Desktop installer per platform from a GitHub Releases page.
- Homebrew tap (`brew install tiro`) as a fast follow.

**Docker packaging** (for home-server / NAS / self-hoster users):
- Official `ghcr.io/esagduyu/tiro` image, multi-arch (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64` for Raspberry Pi and Apple Silicon servers).
- `docker-compose.yml` template under `deploy/docker/` with:
  - The Tiro service.
  - Persistent volume for the library directory.
  - Optional sidecar for a local model server (Ollama).
  - Optional sidecar for a self-hosted MinIO if the user wants BYO sync stored next to Tiro.
- Container env vars mirror config.yaml keys (`TIRO_LIBRARY_PATH`, `TIRO_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.) for the docker-native config flow.
- First-run inside the container skips the interactive `tiro init` and reads from env.
- Auto-update via the same release manifest the desktop installer uses; `watchtower`-friendly tags.
- Documented as the recommended path for users running Tiro on a Synology, Unraid, or always-on Linux box.

**Migration framework**:
- `tiro/migrations/` directory with versioned SQL/Python migration files.
- `tiro migrate` CLI; auto-runs on server start with confirmation if schema version differs.
- Migration runs always preceded by an auto-backup snapshot.

### Out of scope

- Mobile native apps (PWA from Phase 3 remains the mobile story).
- Auto-updating the Chrome extension (the Chrome Web Store handles this once published; submission is its own track).
- Multi-platform CI for binary builds — assume manual builds for first release, automate later.

### Dependencies

- All earlier phases.
- A code-signing certificate procurement (macOS Developer ID, Windows EV).
- A release-hosting decision (GitHub Releases vs custom CDN).

### Acceptance criteria

- A non-technical user can download a `.dmg`/`.exe`/`.AppImage`, install Tiro, complete onboarding, and reach the inbox without using a terminal.
- The app survives reboot via the configured service manager.
- Auto-update from version N → N+1 succeeds without data loss.
- Migration framework tested with a forward migration and a rollback drill.

### Test plan

- Manual platform installs (macOS at minimum; Linux + Windows as fast follows).
- Migration tests: take a v0.6 library, install v0.7, confirm data integrity post-migration.
- Service restart test: kill process, confirm restart by launchd/systemd.

### Risks and gotchas

- **Bundling Python is painful**. Allow significant time for the first binary build. PyInstaller is the well-trodden path; PyOxidizer is faster but more brittle.
- **ChromaDB native deps** (RocksDB or similar) may fail to package on Windows. Test early.
- **macOS Gatekeeper / Windows SmartScreen** will block unsigned binaries. Code signing is non-negotiable for public distribution.
- **Library migration risks data loss**. The migration must be a copy-then-confirm-then-remove, never a move.
- **CLAUDE.md warns about port-8000 conflicts**. The Tauri wrapper using a random port avoids this.

## Phase 6 — Agent Runtime

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE — shipped and tagged `v0.8.0` (2026-07-18).** K1 (kernel, migration 014), K2 (all four AI features migrated behind golden gates, `/agents` page, replay, evals), K3 (personas + structural sandbox + suggestions, migration 017), and K4 (ContradictionDetector + on-ingest hooks) are all merged; CLAUDE.md's Phase 6 conventions bullets are current where details drifted. Where this section's original sketch conflicts with the frozen kernel spec (`docs/plans/2026-07-06-agent-runtime-spec.md`) or the banked K3/K4 plans, those win.

**Release target:** `0.8 agent-runtime-beta`
**Relative complexity:** XL
**Goal:** Replace direct prompt calls with an extensible, inspectable library of local agents with replayable traces and a plugin API.

> **Amended 2026-07-03 — see "Decisions Made" #0:** MCP servers are now table stakes across competitors; the local agent runtime over audit-logged files-on-disk is the durable differentiator. Treat this phase as strategic payload, not nice-to-have.

> **Amended 2026-07-06 — kernel designed (Decision #9):** the runtime kernel has an approved design (local planning docs: spec + K1–K4 skeleton plan), deliberately **kernel-deep, roster-shallow** to honor this section's own abstraction-risk warning. Frozen there: structural provenance (context auto-captures citations + traces; no other data/LLM path), traces as files with `agent_runs` as index, NO second provider abstraction (Decision #7's tier map is the seam; replay adds only a per-run model override), and the trust boundary **code agents may write, personas may only suggest** (structural sandbox: scope-derived read-only contexts, a suggestions-and-accept surface, no network tools). ContradictionDetector is the first new agent (owner priority). Where this section's sketch conflicts with that spec, the spec wins.

### Why this phase, why now

By 0.7 we have multiple ad-hoc AI features (metadata extractor, digest writer, ingenuity analyst, preference classifier). We are about to add more (highlight summarizer, contradiction detector, reading coach). Continuing as ad-hoc prompts means N feature surfaces with N prompt-update patterns, N retry strategies, N observability stories.

Crucially, this phase is *sixth*, not earlier, because the right abstractions for an agent runtime are only visible after you have shipped enough agents to see the patterns. Building the runtime before shipping notes and RSS risks designing for hypotheticals.

### In scope

**Tiro Agent contract**:
- A typed Python interface for agents:
  ```python
  class TiroAgent(Protocol):
      name: str
      version: str
      inputs: dict[str, type]   # named args
      tools: list[str]          # tools requested
      outputs: type             # pydantic model
      def run(ctx: AgentContext, **kwargs) -> AgentResult: ...
  ```
- `AgentContext` exposes: search, get article, get highlights, write note, create digest, update tags, classify, export — same tools as MCP, intentionally.
- `AgentResult`: outputs + citations (article IDs referenced) + token usage + cost estimate + trace.

**Migrate existing AI features**:
- `MetadataExtractor` agent (replaces direct Haiku call in `processor.py`).
- `DigestWriter` agent (replaces `digest.py` Opus call).
- `IngenuityAnalyst` agent.
- `PreferenceClassifier` agent.
- All preserve current behavior; the migration is a refactor, not a feature change.

**New agents**:
- `HighlightSummarizer` — weekly digest of recent highlights with thematic grouping.
- `ContradictionDetector` — flags articles whose claims contradict each other. Triggers proactively on ingest when a new article contradicts a previously highly-rated one (notification, not just digest item).
- `ReadingCoach` — surfaces reading habit insights weekly. Uses the scroll-depth/dwell data from Phase 2.
- `ArgumentMapper` — for opinion and analysis articles, extracts logical structure (premises → evidence → conclusions → unstated assumptions). Renders as an interactive map (reuse the d3 infra from the knowledge graph).
- `TemporalAnalyst` — tracks how coverage of a topic evolves over time across the user's sources. Output is a timeline with stance/framing annotations. Triggered ad-hoc ("how has coverage of X shifted?") and as a monthly digest section.
- `SourceAuthorityScorer` — builds a PageRank-style authority graph from hyperlinks preserved within saved articles. Sources frequently cited by other saved articles gain authority. Surfaces in the knowledge graph as "foundational sources" and feeds into digest ranking as a tiebreaker.
- `MultiModelAnalyst` — runs the same analysis prompt through multiple models (Opus, Sonnet, GPT-4, Gemini, local) and surfaces disagreement. Useful both for reducing AI-layer bias and as a power-user feature.
- `WikiMaintainer` persona set — the Phase 1b wiki's ingester/synthesizer/linter operations re-homed as first-class agents (Decision #8, wave W4). `wiki/_schema.md` is literally their prompt; the wiki becomes the flagship demonstration of the runtime.
- `ImportanceScorer` — the opt-in local model over reading-telemetry signals (see Phase 2 instrumentation); its scores feed wiki weighting and digest ranking.

**Agent personas (the user-facing form of the runtime — Decision #8):**
- A persona is a spec file in `{library}/personas/`: markdown body = prompt template; YAML frontmatter declares `scope` (`article` | `day` | `query` | `library`), `schedule` (on-ingest / cron-style / manual), model tier (`heavy`/`light`), and `output` target (note, digest section, wiki page, tier suggestion).
- Today's four AI features (metadata extractor, digest writer, analyst, classifier) ship as the built-in persona set — user-readable, user-forkable, exactly the Obsidian core-plugins move. The agent-migration work above and personas are the same work seen from two sides.
- Personas are shareable (a persona file is self-contained); community personas are the most likely first plugin ecosystem.
- **Sandboxing is in the spec from v1, not retrofitted**: no network access, read access to library content, write access only to the declared output target, outputs rendered through the standard sanitize path and never fed to other personas as trusted instructions (prompt-injection posture: persona prompts from the community are untrusted input).

**Provider adapters**:
- `AnthropicProvider` (Opus + Haiku).
- `OpenAIProvider` (GPT family + Agents-style workflow support).
- `LocalProvider` (Ollama integration; document recommended local models).
- `MCPProvider` — agent execution delegated to an external MCP-connected assistant.

**Agent run history**:
- New table `agent_runs`: `id, agent_name, agent_version, started_at, completed_at, status, provider, model, input_json, output_json, citations, tokens_in, tokens_out, cost_usd, error`.
- `/agents` view: list runs, filter by agent/date/status, click to view trace, replay button.
- Replay: re-run an agent against the same inputs (useful when prompts or models change).

**Evals**:
- `tiro/evals/` directory with per-agent fixture datasets.
- `tiro evals run [agent]` runs all fixtures, reports pass/fail vs. expected outputs.
- Required for prompt changes: CI gate (manual at first, automated when Phase 5 CI lands).

**Plugin API** (broader than agents — covers all three plugin types from the spec vision):
- **Agent plugins** — third-party agents installable via `pip install tiro-agent-foo` or dropped into `~/.tiro/plugins/agents/`. Manifest declares name, version, required tools, API permissions, model preferences.
- **Ingestion plugins** — custom connectors (e.g., a community-maintained Mastodon connector, a custom corporate Confluence connector). Manifest declares URL patterns matched, MIME types, and the extract function. Drop into `~/.tiro/plugins/ingestion/`. Hooked into `process_article()` before the default web/email pipeline.
- **Theme plugins** — community themes as `.css` files dropped into `~/.tiro/plugins/themes/`. Show up in the Settings appearance picker alongside `papyrus` and `roman-night`. Theme manifest optional (just CSS works); manifest adds an icon and display name.
- All plugin types use the same manifest schema (`plugin.toml`) with a `type:` discriminator.
- User confirms install; plugins run in the same process with no sandbox initially (sandbox is post-1.0). Plugins requiring network or file-system access prompt for permission.
- `tiro plugin install <path-or-pypi-name>`, `tiro plugin list`, `tiro plugin remove <name>` CLI.

### Out of scope

- Multi-agent orchestration (one agent at a time this phase).
- Web-based agent marketplace.
- Sandboxing plugins (deferred until threat model demands it).

### Dependencies

- Phases 0–4 complete.
- AI eval harness foundation from Phase 0 test work.

### Acceptance criteria

- All existing AI features run through the agent runtime with identical user-visible behavior.
- Switching the digest agent from Anthropic to OpenAI requires one config change.
- Every AI call is traceable in `/agents` with full inputs, outputs, and cost.
- Replaying a run with a different model produces a new run record, leaving the original intact.
- An example third-party agent (`tiro-agent-example`) is installable from PyPI and visible in the UI.

### Test plan

- `tests/test_agents.py` — contract conformance, provider switching, error handling.
- `tests/evals/` — fixture-driven evals for each first-party agent.
- Manual: install the example third-party agent, run it, verify trace.

### Risks and gotchas

- **Abstraction risk**: the runtime should be designed *from* the existing agents, not *for* hypothetical ones. Refactor existing first; new agents second.
- **Cost estimation is provider-specific** and tariffs change. Encapsulate per-provider, treat as best-effort.
- **MCPProvider is complex** — defer until the others work.
- **Plugin loading is a security surface**. Document loudly; require explicit user confirmation per plugin.

## Phase 7a — BYO Cloud Sync (free, open)

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE — shipped and tagged `v0.9.0` (2026-07-18).** S1–S6 all merged (migrations 015/016/018); the v1.0.0 gate (S2 property suite + S5 multi-device suite) is GREEN. The owner's physical acceptance matrix (2 laptops + phone) remains the final pre-v1.0.0 verification; CLAUDE.md's sync conventions bullets are current where details drifted. The full design is frozen (Decision #9, spec `docs/plans/2026-07-06-sync-engine-spec.md`) with the deltas recorded below (no CRDT — LWW + conflict files; state-diff capture; audio excluded; Argon2id→X25519 age identity). S2's property suite + S5's multi-device suite are the v1.0.0 go/no-go gate. Where this section conflicts with that spec or the banked S2–S6 plans, those win.

**Release target:** `0.9 sync-beta`
**Relative complexity:** L
**Goal:** Multi-device sync where the user owns the storage. Tiro never holds the data.

### Why this phase, why now

The local-first promise is strongest when "syncing across my devices" doesn't require trusting a Tiro-operated server. BYO sync ships **before** the paid hosted product on purpose: it's the version that matches the philosophy. Tiro Cloud (Phase 7b) is the convenience layer that funds the open work; it must never become the only way to use Tiro across devices.

The model is borrowed from Obsidian: the file-and-DB layout is sync-friendly by construction, and any commodity storage backend can hold it.

> **Amended 2026-07-06 — designed, with deltas (Decision #9):** this phase now has an approved design (local planning docs: spec + S1–S6 skeleton plan) that **absorbs Phase 2b** as its first milestone (S1, local reconcile engine — independently shippable). Deliberate deltas from the sketch below, all owner-decided: **no CRDT library** — LWW + both-versions-kept conflict files for notes/highlights (the CRDT bullet below is superseded; the journal format keeps CRDT headroom); change capture is **state-diff against a shadow manifest**, never write-site instrumentation; **audio never syncs** (derived cache, regenerated per device, like vectors); `reading_stats` stays device-local in v1; encryption is an **Argon2id-derived X25519 age identity** (keeps this section's Argon2id while staying reproducible in Swift and browser for the iOS v2 replica and 7b). Where this section conflicts with that spec, the spec wins.

### In scope

**Sync engine**:
- A storage-backend-agnostic sync layer in `tiro/sync/`.
- One source-of-truth concept: the library directory plus its sidecars (articles markdown, notes, annotations JSONL, an exported snapshot of SQLite-derived state).
- ChromaDB is **not** synced; vectors regenerate locally from synced articles on first run on a new device. This avoids ChromaDB version-lock and keeps embeddings as a derived cache.
- SQLite mutable state synced as a periodic full snapshot + a journal of recent ops between snapshots (CRDT-style for notes, last-write-wins for metadata).
- Conflict resolution per field type:
  - Notes / highlights (user text): CRDT (Yjs or Automerge), "both versions kept" UI in the rare manual case.
  - Ratings, VIP flags, read status: last-write-wins.
  - AI outputs (digests, analyses): re-generatable, prefer the newer version.

**Storage backend adapters**:
- `S3Adapter` — works with AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, MinIO, any S3-compatible. User provides endpoint + access key.
- `WebDAVAdapter` — works with Nextcloud, Fastmail Files, generic WebDAV.
- `FilesystemAdapter` — for users who already sync a folder via Dropbox/iCloud/Google Drive/Syncthing. Just point Tiro at the synced folder; Tiro doesn't talk to those services directly. Coordination via lock files.
- Adapter contract is small (`put`, `get`, `list`, `delete`, `lock`, `unlock`) so the community can add more.

**Encryption**:
- Optional client-side encryption (default on for S3/WebDAV, off for Filesystem since those vendors handle TLS at rest).
- Key derived from a user passphrase (Argon2id). Passphrase entered on each device pair.
- Encrypted blobs use age (`age` format) — auditable, simple, well-reviewed.

**Device pairing**:
- Pair a new device by entering: storage backend creds + passphrase. That's it.
- Or scan a QR code from an already-paired device that bundles (storage backend URL, masked creds the new device decrypts via a one-time pairing key, passphrase entry still required).
- Per-device last-sync timestamp visible in Settings → Sync.

**Sync UX**:
- `/settings/sync` configures the backend, runs the first sync, shows progress.
- Status indicator in the sidebar (last sync time, sync errors).
- Manual "Sync now" button + keyboard shortcut.
- Background sync interval configurable (default 5 min).
- Pause sync, force-resync, repair (delete cloud snapshot and re-upload from local).

### Out of scope (this phase)

- Hosted-by-Tiro sync (that's Phase 7b).
- Hosted agent runtime (Phase 7b).
- Sharing — handled in Phase 7b with the hosted infrastructure.
- Multi-user / team libraries (post-1.0, conditional).

### Dependencies

- All earlier phases. Phase 1 backup snapshots are the foundation of the snapshot format used here.

### Acceptance criteria

- Two laptops + one phone, one user, BYO S3 bucket: edit on any device, see changes on the others within one sync interval, no data loss across realistic conflict scenarios.
- Wiping a device and re-pairing with passphrase and bucket creds restores the full library.
- Encrypted bucket contents are unreadable to anyone with bucket access but not the passphrase.
- ChromaDB regenerates correctly on first sync on a new device.
- Filesystem adapter survives the common "edit on two offline devices, both come online" Dropbox-style scenario without corruption.

### Test plan

- Property-based tests for the CRDT merge across realistic edit sequences.
- Adapter conformance tests run against MinIO (S3), a Nextcloud Docker (WebDAV), and a local temp dir (Filesystem) in CI.
- Multi-device integration tests using multiple `TestClient` instances pointed at a shared MinIO.
- Encryption round-trip test: encrypt locally, fetch as raw bytes, attempt decrypt with wrong passphrase, attempt with right one.
- "Recover from corrupted snapshot" drill.

### Risks and gotchas

- **CRDT scope creep**: only notes need a real CRDT. Apply last-write-wins everywhere else aggressively; otherwise this phase becomes 2x bigger.
- **Filesystem adapter and Dropbox/iCloud are tricky**: those services aren't real filesystems — they do lazy sync, conflict files, partial writes. Document this clearly; recommend S3-compatible backends as the better path for active multi-device users.
- **Passphrase loss is unrecoverable** (no key escrow, by design). The UX must be relentless: print recovery codes on setup, prompt for backup, warn before every destructive sync op.
- **ChromaDB regeneration is slow** on a large library (re-embedding all articles). Show progress; do it in the background; let the UI work against SQLite while embeddings rebuild.
- **Schema migrations across devices**: a device on v0.9 and a device on v1.0 sharing a bucket. Define a sync-format version separate from the app version; refuse to sync if format-version mismatch; surface upgrade prompt.

## Phase 7b — Tiro Cloud (paid, hosted)

**Release target:** `1.0 cloud-beta`
**Relative complexity:** XL
**Goal:** Hosted convenience subscription that funds the open product. Patterned on Obsidian Sync: nothing here is unavailable to free users running BYO sync.

### Why this phase, why now

BYO sync (7a) is the philosophical default. Tiro Cloud is the "I'd rather pay $X/mo than manage a bucket and an Anthropic key" option. It also offers a place to run agents continuously without keeping a laptop awake — which is the practical wedge for users with home/work computers that aren't always on.

The pricing model is "Tiro Supporter" — explicitly framed as supporting the open product, not unlocking features. Everything the cloud does, the local + BYO user can do for themselves.

### In scope

**Hosted sync**:
- Tiro-operated S3-compatible storage with client-side encryption preserved (same age-encrypted blobs as 7a; Tiro never sees plaintext).
- A managed sync endpoint over HTTPS so users don't manage storage credentials.
- Same conflict resolution as 7a (the engine is shared).
- Bandwidth and storage tiers; default tier sized for a typical reading library.

**Hosted agent runtime**:
- Tiro Cloud runs the Phase 6 agent runtime on a server that's always on. Subscribers' scheduled digests, IMAP polling, RSS fetching, and proactive contradiction alerts continue when their laptop is closed.
- Same agent code as local; no feature divergence.
- Per-user resource limits so a runaway agent can't take down the service.

**Managed AI baseline**:
- Included monthly quota of Claude/OpenAI calls (calibrated to the average reader's needs).
- BYO-key override always available and free (a subscriber who hits quota can flip to their own key without losing the subscription benefits of hosted sync + hosted runtime).
- Cost transparency dashboard: tokens used, dollars consumed, projection.
- No silent throttling; overage requires explicit user opt-in to spend.

**Hosted web/mobile access**:
- For users who don't run Tiro Local at all: a hosted FastAPI instance serves the same UI against the user's encrypted cloud library. Decryption happens client-side in the browser via the user's passphrase.
- This is the "I just want to read on my phone, I don't want to run a server" tier.

**Backups, restore points, version history**:
- Server-side immutable backups (separate from the user-controllable backups in Phase 1).
- Version history for individual articles and notes — restore prior versions through a timeline UI.
- Time-limited retention (e.g. 30 days) on free trial; longer on the paid plan.

**Read-only share links** (the narrow, defensible version of sharing):
- Generate a share URL for a single article + its notes/highlights, or for a saved-view's article list.
- The URL fragment contains a decryption key; the server can't read the shared content.
- Recipient can read in a browser. Subscribing to ongoing updates requires the recipient to be a Tiro user.
- Export-as-newsletter for digests: render a digest as a static, sharable HTML page (no decryption needed; user opted to make this one digest public).
- This is the "Reading is your own, but I can show you something specific" posture — see Out of Scope below for what's deferred.

**Billing & ops**:
- Stripe (or equivalent) subscription handling.
- Single tier at launch ("Tiro Supporter, $X/mo"); annual discount.
- Clear cancel-anytime; data export on cancel keeps the user whole.
- Status page; alerting; on-call rotation considerations.

### Out of scope (this phase)

- Team / library workspaces (deferred to a possible 1.x; see "Social posture" note in Out-Of-Scope below).
- Public reading lists, follow graphs, social discovery (deferred-but-not-killed; see "Social posture").
- Comments on shared content.

### Dependencies

- Phase 6 agent runtime (hosted runtime is a deploy of it).
- Phase 7a sync engine (hosted sync is the same engine pointed at Tiro-operated buckets).
- Infrastructure decisions (hosting provider, payment processor, legal entity).
- Compliance work for handling user data at rest (terms, privacy policy, GDPR, payment processing).

### Acceptance criteria

- A user on the Cloud tier can pair their devices to Tiro Cloud, have scheduled digests run server-side overnight, and read them on their phone in the morning without ever opening a laptop.
- A user can cancel, export everything, and resume on BYO sync with no data loss.
- Server-side bucket inspection confirms only ciphertext blobs are present (no plaintext anywhere except in transit, end-to-end encrypted).
- AI quota tracking is accurate within $0.10/month; overage requires explicit opt-in.
- Share link with passphrase fragment opens in a browser and renders the article correctly; without fragment it fails closed.

### Test plan

- Multi-device sync tests reused from Phase 7a, run against the hosted backend.
- Pen test of the sync, agent, and billing APIs.
- Load tests for the hosted agent runtime (N concurrent users, scheduled digests at the same minute).
- Property-based tests for billing/quota accounting.
- Cancellation drill: subscribe, populate, cancel, export, re-import on BYO. Diff for parity.

### Risks and gotchas

- **AI quota cost forecasting** is the operational risk that has bankrupted infra startups. Quota must be enforced, not estimated. Overage strictly opt-in.
- **Hosted agent runtime is N times more expensive than client-side** because it runs continuously. The pricing model must account for both AI spend and compute spend.
- **Encryption-at-rest UX**: lose passphrase, lose data. Recovery codes mandatory; communicate relentlessly.
- **Compliance scope expands** the moment you store paying users' data and process payments. Budget for legal counsel before launch, not after.
- **Don't gate features behind cloud**. Every time a feature is added, ask: does this work for the local user? If no, reconsider.
- **Encrypted-at-rest for the local SQLite/ChromaDB** is a separate request (privacy-conscious users on shared machines). Worth shipping alongside this phase as a `tiro encrypt-library` opt-in that wraps the library directory with age. Documented as a Local feature, not a Cloud feature.

---

## Cross-Cutting Tracks

These run alongside the phased work; each is small enough to absorb into the relevant phase but should not be forgotten.

### Telemetry & Observability

- **Local-only structured logs** under `<library>/logs/{date}.jsonl`. Tools: `tiro logs`, `tiro logs --grep`, `tiro logs --since 1h`.
- **Opt-in crash reporting** (Sentry or self-hosted equivalent). Off by default; turning it on is a Settings toggle with a clear privacy explanation. **Never** ship telemetry on by default.
- **Health endpoint** `/healthz` returning version, uptime, store sizes, background task status.
- **`tiro status`** CLI summarizing the same.
- **Opt-in feature-usage telemetry** (the adoption instrument): anonymous, feature-level counters only — e.g. `highlights_created`, `digests_generated`, `swipe_triage_used` — never content, URLs, titles, or identifiers. Off by default; asked exactly once during Phase 5 onboarding with a plain-language explanation and a visible payload preview. Locally inspectable (`tiro telemetry show`) before anything is sent. This is how "daily-use adoption" (Product Strategy north-star) gets measured for users who consent; downloads/stars remain the proxy for everyone else.

**External API audit log** (the privacy-transparency feature):
- Every call to a non-local service logged to `<library>/audit/{date}.jsonl`: timestamp, service (`anthropic`, `openai`, `imap.gmail.com`, `smtp.gmail.com`, `s3.amazonaws.com`, etc.), endpoint, byte counts in/out, token counts where applicable, dollar estimate, request_id, success/failure.
- `tiro audit` CLI: filter by service/date/cost. `tiro audit --month` summarizes monthly outbound traffic and AI spend.
- `/audit` web view: same data with charts.
- This is a **trust feature**: the user can answer "what has Tiro sent to whom?" at any moment.
- Foundation laid in Phase 0 (the Anthropic/OpenAI calls during ingestion and digest). Extended in every phase that adds an external dependency (IMAP/SMTP in Phase 0 already; sync backends in Phase 7a; hosted services in Phase 7b).

Land the local logging and AI audit log in Phase 0; extend the audit log per phase as new external services are added; add opt-in crash reporting in Phase 5 (when there are many install-base users to debug for).

### AI Eval Harness

- Beyond unit tests: fixture-based evals for AI features. Each fixture is `(input, expected_property)` — expected properties are predicates, not exact match (Opus outputs vary).
- Examples: "digest includes at least 5 articles," "ingenuity score is within ±2 of human label."
- Lives in `tiro/evals/`. Foundation laid in Phase 0; expanded as agents are added; required CI gate in Phase 5 (agent runtime) and beyond.

### Subscription-AI Bridge

- Many users have Claude Pro / ChatGPT Plus / Gemini Advanced subscriptions and no API key. Three surfaces serve them, in order of standing:
  1. **Expose** (always): MCP server as the primary surface — the user's own assistant works the library.
  2. **Handoff** (Phase 2): a button that creates a "task packet" (article IDs + highlights + notes + a prompt template), copies it to clipboard, opens the user's preferred assistant. Prompt packs with MCP recipes for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Gemini, and local assistants.
  3. **Agent-CLI backends** (Phase 1 M1.0, local-only alpha — Decision #7): headless `claude -p` / Codex CLI invocations of the user's own locally-authenticated CLI as an `llm_call()` backend. Owner-decided path-of-least-resistance for subscription holders; carries the ToS caveats and hosted-mode prohibition recorded in Decision #7. Web-UI automation remains permanently out (see Out-Of-Scope).

Land MCP-side improvements in Phase 6 (agent runtime). Land handoff UI in Phase 2 (notes) since highlights/notes are the most valuable content for assistant handoff.

### Rich Media & Social Connectors

Deferred past 1.0. Suggested order when picked up:

1. **PDF connector** with OCR fallback and citation extraction.
2. **YouTube transcript** connector with timestamped sections.
3. **Podcast transcription** connector.
4. **Twitter / X thread connector** — extension-side DOM capture preferred over server-side scraping (X actively breaks scrapers). Thread unrolling, author attribution, media URL references. Defer until the agent runtime and plugin system are stable — this should probably ship as a community-maintained ingestion plugin (Phase 6 plugin API) rather than a first-party connector, given the maintenance burden.

These are high-value but each is a multi-week project with significant ongoing maintenance (API drift, transcription cost, media-specific UX, anti-scraping cat-and-mouse for X). The product loop is stronger with notes + RSS + sync than with five more connectors.

### Documentation Maintenance

- `CLAUDE.md` should be updated at the end of each phase (the `claude-md-improver` skill is the tool for this).
- `README.md` features section should track the current release.
- `PROJECT_TIRO_SPEC.md` is now historical (hackathon spec); preserve it but mark it as such.
- Add `docs/architecture/` with diagrams — **now actionable** (Phase 5 landed 2026-07-10; the desktop install creates users who need an architecture doc to debug from). Not yet written; `docs/RUNBOOK-desktop.md` covers the operational side in the meantime.

---

## Out-Of-Scope For This Roadmap

The following are non-goals through Phase 7b. Some are permanent ("never"); others are **deferred-but-not-killed** with explicit revisit triggers. Planning agents should not drift into them; product strategy may revisit per the trigger.

**Permanent non-goals:**
- **Automating consumer chat subscriptions via their web UIs.** Tiro does not drive Claude.ai / ChatGPT / Gemini Advanced web interfaces — no browser automation, ever. (Headless *agent-CLI* backends running the user's own locally-authenticated CLI are a separate, narrowly-scoped surface governed by Decision #7 — local-only alpha, ToS-caveated, never hosted.)
- **Generic note-taking app.** Notes serve articles; Tiro is not a Notion replacement.
- **In-app web browsing.** Tiro is downstream of save events, not a browser.
- **Building yet another AI chat UI.** Tiro is a reading OS that *uses* AI; it is not a chatbot.
- **Default-on telemetry.** Never. Telemetry is always opt-in with clear consent UI.

**Deferred — revisit at scale:**
- **Social posture (sharing, reading groups, public reading lists, follow graphs, comments, public profiles).** The current product is "your reading is your own" — this scales better and is easier to defend. **However**, if Tiro reaches meaningful user scale (suggested triggers: ≥10k MAU, or repeated explicit user requests for cross-user discovery and sharing), this decision should be revisited. The endgame possibility worth preserving: users opt-in to share their learnings, VIP authors, highlight collections, and digest archives as a follow-able feed. Architecting Phase 7b around encrypted per-user blobs keeps this option open without committing to it; designing it out (e.g., by adopting a hard "no user-to-user data flow ever" stance) would foreclose it.
- **Team / multi-user accounts.** Single-user is the design center through Phase 7b. Team libraries are a possible 1.x track conditional on personal sync being excellent and on demand actually existing among reached users.
- **Cross-user discovery / recommendation.** Same trigger as social posture. If Tiro ever exposes "what other users with similar libraries are saving," it should be opt-in, anonymized, and live entirely in the Cloud tier (BYO sync users opt out by virtue of not having a Tiro-operated server seeing their data).

## Decisions Made

Strategic decisions that were Open Questions in earlier roadmap revisions but have been resolved. Captured here so planning agents have the rationale, not just the conclusion.

0. **2026-07-03 strategy inputs (ingest before planning Phase 1+).** Two deep-research reports (local-only, `docs/plans/2026-07-03-competitive-intelligence.md` and `2026-07-03-native-app-strategy.md`) produced recommendations that AMEND this roadmap's assumptions without restructuring its phases:
   - **Phase 4 importers**: the Pocket-refugee thesis is stale (Pocket shut down 2025, exports closed, no article text). Re-aim importers at Readwise/Instapaper/Omnivore-zip refugees and add forwarding-address email ingestion.
   - **Pull forward into Phase 1**: a Dockerfile/compose and a minimal second AI provider (Ollama or OpenAI) — both flagged as adoption blockers; the latter makes "model-agnostic" true rather than aspirational. Per-item summaries are commoditized — position on cross-document synthesis.
   - **Phase 3 priority elevated**: mobile is the competitive field's biggest gap vs Tiro; the PWA is the bridge, and a **native SwiftUI iPhone app (thin MIT-licensed API client) should be dispatched right after Phase 3 ships** — NOT as a replacement for Phase 5's Tauri desktop (different products: Phase 5 packages the Python server itself). iOS PWAs permanently lack share_target, so skip hybrid stepping-stones. The offline-replica variant waits for Phase 7a (swift-embeddings + sqlite-vec, parity-gated).
   - **MCP servers are now table stakes** across competitors — the durable differentiator is the local agent runtime (Phase 6) over audit-logged files-on-disk, so treat Phase 6 as strategic payload, not nice-to-have.
   - **7b pricing posture**: single Supporter tier at $6–8/mo (below Readwise), BYO-key free forever — consistent with Decision 1 below.
   - Post-Phase-0 review deferrals for Phase 1's first commit: vector-metadata parity in `retry_pending_vectors`, and the two unlogged audit edges (TTS mid-stream disconnect, imap.search raise).

1. **Pricing model: single tier.** Tiro Cloud launches as a single "Tiro Supporter" subscription — flat monthly with an annual discount. No storage tiers, no AI tiers, no per-feature gating. Rationale: the model is "support the open product," and tiering would muddy that message. Add tiers only if usage patterns force the issue post-launch (e.g., a small minority of users consuming an order of magnitude more AI than the rest).

2. **License: AGPL across the project.** Tiro moves from MIT to AGPL-3.0. Rationale: AGPL doesn't affect end-users running Tiro on their own laptop/server (they aren't redistributing a service), but it does discourage hosted clones from competing with Tiro Cloud without contributing back. The local-first user base is unaffected; the paid Cloud business is protected. Existing contributions remain MIT-licensed at their commit point; future contributions are AGPL. The license change applies to Tiro Local, Phase 7a (BYO sync), and Phase 7b (Tiro Cloud server) uniformly — keeping the licensing story simple. *(Action item completed 2026-05-28: LICENSE, README grandfather clause, and pyproject metadata all updated.)*

3. **Obsidian bidirectional sync: shipping in Phase 2b.** Promoted from "open question" to a committed phase. See Phase 2b above. Rationale: Obsidian is the closest neighboring product, the user bases overlap, and treating Obsidian as a peer is a defensible differentiator that nobody else in the read-it-later space offers. *(Amended 2026-07-06: the commitment stands, but the delivery vehicle changed — Phase 2b is absorbed into Phase 7a as the sync engine's first milestone. See Decision #9.)*

4. **Twitter / X connector: deferred past 1.0.** Moved out of Phase 4 into the post-1.0 Rich Media & Social Connectors track, likely shipped as a community ingestion plugin rather than first-party code. Rationale: X's anti-scraping environment makes maintenance expensive, the user value-per-engineering-week is lower than RSS or Pocket import, and the plugin API (Phase 6) is a more sustainable home for fragile connectors.

5. **Cloud architecture: BYO-first, hosted-second.** Phase 7a (BYO sync) ships before Phase 7b (Tiro Cloud). The free version of multi-device sync exists before the paid hosted version. Tiro Cloud is convenience, never a feature gate.

6. **Social posture: deferred with explicit trigger.** Single-user only through Phase 7b. Revisit when **≥10k MAU OR ≥100 distinct user requests for cross-user sharing**, whichever comes first. Phase 7b's architecture (per-user encrypted blobs) keeps the future open without committing to it.

7. **2026-07-04 — AI layer: provider-agnostic in three stages; subscription-CLI backends in the local alpha.** Full inputs: 2026-07-04 strategic code review + `claude -p` ToS scoping (local reports in `docs/plans/`).
   - **Staging**: (A) Phase 1 M1.0 ships the `llm_call()` chokepoint — call sites request capability *tiers* (`heavy`/`light`), config maps tiers to `(provider, model)`, prompts move to data. (B) The same milestone lands the first non-Anthropic API backend (Decision #0), which is what actually validates the abstraction. (C) Broad agnosticism (OpenAI-compatible generic endpoint + Ollama local) rides on B nearly free and lands with/before Phase 6's provider adapters. Thin hand-rolled adapter; no LangChain/LiteLLM-class dependency.
   - **Agent-CLI backends (owner decision)**: most target users already pay for an AI subscription; the path of least resistance matters more than API-key purity for the local alpha. M1.0 therefore ships `claude-cli` and `codex-cli` backends: subprocess headless invocation of the **user's own locally-installed, locally-authenticated** CLI, JSON envelope parsed, settings-isolated spawn (no MCP/instruction-file leakage), install/login detection in Settings, plan-rate-limit errors surfaced gracefully. Default to `heavy`-tier work only (digests/analysis) — spawn latency and plan rate-windows make CLIs wrong for batch extraction.
   - **Recorded caveats (eyes-open decision)**: Anthropic's Claude Code legal terms state third-party developers should use API keys and may not route requests through consumer-plan credentials; the owner's read is that a local-only, open-source app spawning the user's own CLI on their own machine is materially different from a hosted service intermediating credentials, and accepts the residual risk **for the local alpha**. Mitigations: feature is opt-in in Settings (never default), labeled experimental with the ToS note, disabled the moment a hosted context is detected, and **Tiro Cloud (7b) and any Tiro-operated runtime never touch subscription auth — API-key/managed-quota only there, no exceptions**. Codex CLI's terms need the equivalent check before that backend ships (Open Strategic Question #8). Seeking written clarification from Anthropic/OpenAI is the standing action item; if either says no, the corresponding backend is dropped without architectural loss (it's one backend behind the chokepoint).

8. **2026-07-04 — LLM wiki adopted as the synthesis strategy; reading-telemetry as its trust signal.** Full design: `docs/plans/2026-07-04-llm-wiki-design-exploration.md` (local). Inspired by Karpathy's LLM-wiki pattern (immutable sources → LLM-compiled wiki → schema; ingest/query/lint), adapted to Tiro's economics and trust posture.
   - **Shape**: `{library}/wiki/` as a files-as-truth fifth artifact (backed up/exported; SQLite is a derived index; doctor reconciles the index, never deletes pages). Entity/concept pages with mandatory citations; `wiki/_schema.md` as the user-editable Layer 3 that later becomes the wiki-maintainer persona prompt. The knowledge graph becomes the wiki's map.
   - **Phasing**: W1 MVP ships as **Phase 1b** (on-demand only, mark-stale, zero background cost); W2 nightly sync + digest-as-knowledge-diff; W3 lint incl. lint-proposes-next-reads; W4 folds maintainers into Phase 6 personas. Finetuning-on-your-library: parked, 7b-era.
   - **Anti-poisoning posture** (the design's central risk): mandatory citations; page updates consume article summaries + prior page only (wiki never reads wiki); regenerate-from-scratch always available; on-demand ships before any automation; extraction-quality fixes (truncation, entity canonicalization) are hard prerequisites in M1.0. **Reading telemetry is the importance signal** (owner direction): local-only %-read/active-seconds/likes/favorited-authors (Phase 2 instrumentation) weight wiki synthesis toward what the user actually engaged with; later, an opt-in locally-running lightweight importance model trained on those signals scores content continuously (local inference only — same posture as local embeddings, never a cloud call, consistent with the telemetry principles: local by default, opt-in for anything more).
   - **Agent personas confirmed as the Phase 6 user-facing frame**: spec files (prompt + scope + schedule + output target) in `{library}/personas/`, shareable; today's four AI features become the built-in set; sandboxing in the spec from v1. M1.0 builds the prerequisites (prompts-as-data, tiers, scheduler registry), not the framework.

9. **2026-07-06 — Fable design session: four workstreams specced before implementation.** With Phase 3 shipped at `v0.5.0`, a single deep-design session banked specs (all local planning docs under `docs/plans/`, dated 2026-07-06) so later, cheaper sessions execute rather than re-decide. **Update 2026-07-10: the first two workstreams below (frontend overhaul, iOS v1.0) have SHIPPED; the latter two (sync engine, agent-runtime kernel) remain design-only and feed Phases 7a and 6.**
   - **Frontend design overhaul** — **✅ SHIPPED 2026-07-10** (merged to main, the "Codex" design pass): full visual pass from the owner's design-system artifact — a 55-icon SVG line-icon set replacing every text-glyph/emoji icon, CSS component primitives, editorial serif accents, and three-tier responsive chrome (240px desktop sidebar / 64px tablet icon rail / **phone bottom tab bar replacing the hamburger**). Owner chose full overhaul + bottom tab bar.
   - **Native iOS client v1.0** — **✅ FEATURE-COMPLETE 2026-07-10** (in the separate local repo `tiro-ios`, tag `v0.1.0-tf1`; TestFlight-pending on the owner's Apple team id): SwiftUI thin client per Decision #0's strategy doc; owner chose **everything-in-v1.0 scope** (pairing, inbox triage, reader + highlights, search, digest, Share Extension, TTS with lock-screen controls, offline cache + write queue), **TestFlight-only** distribution for now, and a **separate MIT-licensed repo (`tiro-ios`)**. The two server-side tasks landed in this repo (shipped with Phase 4): a device-pairing flow (`/setup/qr?mode=device` + `POST /api/auth/pair` minting API tokens, mirroring the login-token pattern; PWA cookie lane untouched — two parallel auth lanes forever) and an anchor-parity fixture export so the Swift highlight-anchoring port is test-locked to `annotate.js`.
   - **Sync engine = Phase 7a + absorbed Phase 2b** (spec + S1–S6 skeleton plan; milestones expand into full plans at execution time): see the amended Phase 7a section for the deltas (no CRDT — LWW + conflict files; state-diff capture; audio excluded; Argon2id→X25519 age identity). Phase 2b's section is retained as the requirements source for milestone S1.
   - **Phase 6 agent-runtime kernel** (kernel spec + K1–K4 skeleton plan): see the amended Phase 6 section for the frozen kernel decisions (structural provenance; traces-as-files; no second provider layer; code-agents-write / personas-suggest). ContradictionDetector is the owner's priority new agent. Roster and plugin API stay open, designed at execution time.
   - **Convention established:** skeleton plans freeze milestone boundaries + FROZEN/OPEN markers; each milestone is expanded into a full step-level plan against the then-current codebase right before execution. Session memory carries per-workstream status trackers.

## Open Strategic Questions

These remain unresolved and need product decisions before the relevant phase begins.

1. ~~**Release-hosting decision.** GitHub Releases is the obvious default for Phase 5, but auto-update at scale eventually wants a CDN. Decide before Phase 5 ships.~~ **Resolved (2026-07-10):** Phase 5 shipped on **GitHub Releases** — the desktop update-check polls `releases/latest` and the multi-arch Docker image publishes to `ghcr.io`. A CDN is a scale problem to revisit only if download volume demands it.
2. **Tiro Cloud backend infrastructure choice.** For Phase 7b: own VPS infra vs. managed serverless (Fly.io, Railway) vs. managed K8s vs. fully serverless (Cloudflare Workers + R2). Each has different cost/lock-in/encryption-handling profiles. Phase 7a is unaffected — BYO sync works against any S3-compatible.
3. **Mobile native app trigger.** ~~PWA is the plan through Phase 7b; the threshold for committing to native iOS/Android is unclear.~~ **Resolved:** Decision #0 committed the native iOS client post-Phase-3, and Decision #9 specced v1.0 (TestFlight-only, separate `tiro-ios` repo). Android remains PWA-only with no trigger defined — that half of the question stays open.
4. **MCP-vs-native-tool calling** as the canonical tool surface for the agent runtime. MCP is more portable; native is lower-latency. Phase 6 should standardize on one and clearly support the other.
5. **Plugin sandboxing approach.** Process isolation? WASM? Trust-the-user-with-warnings? Phase 6 ships without a sandbox; the answer to this question determines when sandboxing becomes mandatory.
6. **Pricing point ($X/mo).** The model is decided (single tier); the actual number is not. Calibrate against Obsidian Sync (~$8/mo), Readwise Reader (~$8/mo), and the cost of the bundled AI quota. Recommendation: pick after Phase 6 lands so the actual hosted-AI cost is known, not estimated.
7. **AGPL compatibility for dependencies.** Some existing dependencies may have license terms that interact awkwardly with AGPL. Pre-Phase-0 audit: list every dependency, confirm compatibility, find replacements for any that conflict.
8. **Agent-CLI backend ToS clarity.** Decision #7 ships `claude-cli`/`codex-cli` backends for the local alpha under recorded caveats. Standing actions before they graduate from "experimental": (a) request written clarification from Anthropic on local-only open-source use of `claude -p` with the user's own login; (b) run the equivalent ToS check on OpenAI's Codex CLI before that backend ships at all; (c) drop either backend without ceremony if the answer is no.

## Review Verification (from 2026-05-25 review)

The diagnoses in this roadmap were verified against the live codebase on 2026-05-25:

- `tiro/app.py:184` confirmed `allow_origins=["*"]` with `allow_credentials=True`.
- No `DELETE` route found anywhere in `tiro/api/`.
- `marked.parse()` → `innerHTML` confirmed in `tiro/frontend/static/reader.js` and `tiro/frontend/static/app.js`.
- `Path("config.yaml")` hardcoded in `tiro/api/routes_settings.py`.
- IMAP background task creation only in `tiro/app.py` lifespan; no dynamic start/stop from settings route.
- Zero pytest files in the repo.
- `playwright-tests/` contains 39 PNG screenshots, no test code.

Commands previously run during review (kept for reference):

```bash
uv run python -m compileall tiro scripts
uv run tiro --help
uv run tiro export --help
```

These passed at the time of review. Note: `tiro-mcp --help` is not a help-only path; it initializes the MCP server and loads the embedding model. This should be fixed during Phase 0 (small CLI cleanup).
